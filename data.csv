Defranco your a Trump lover i can smell you! and you stink!
"In regards to other thing of value, its grasping for straws. They want to use that stipulation as information is something of value to nail Trump for an impeachable offense. The thing is, it's a double edged sword, not something that any politician will readily agree to because of hte long term ramifications. Long story short, they nail trump on that, ti will open up every single politician who ever received info from another nation to the same standard. And that will end a lot of political careers. Something the establishment will not let happen."

Preaching tolerance with their fists is what the fools do when theyre to ignorant to use their words.

There can be a lot of racist things in this world but pick your battles please. We need to focus on the serious acts of racism. There is no hint in Planet of the Apes that the apes are synonymous with a group of people. It is clear they show the apes as animals.
"OK, then. Let the Russians testify at the Hillary Clinton criminal trial."

"Given that nations history, did you expect Germany to welcome those hipster Nazis with open arms? To Americans Nazism is an existential thing, but in Germany it was all too real. Their reaction to these identitarians is at least understandable. Plus, when someone exists solely to push other people's buttons, that person will eventually get punched in the face. That's just reality."
"I watch your videos almost everyday, and I was just randomly unsubscribed??? That's annoying. I'm glad your channel was easy to find and in my recommendations. I wonder who else YouTube decided to unsubscribe me from. Grrrrrrr annoying. Well, I'm back."

"Please do a video about the new article claiming the Amazon Alexa saved a woman's life by calling 911 when Amazon is saying it did not happen, I'd like to see this investigated by your team and your opinion"
remember when you were pulled over by the retarded policeman? üòÇ throwback
Whi is it wrong to get truthful information from a foreign government about a corrupt candidate in our country? Should the primary story be the corrupt candidate and not the people who got the information? You don't punch the person who shows you a video tape of your girlfriend cheating.
"Whether or not you sympathise with the Antifa, at least here in Germany they aren't a serious problem. The trouble they cause each year is nothing compared to hooligans for example. Just something blown out of proportion by the media for views. Our police is already handling these kind of protests rather aggressively. Not something on my list of things to worry over. Just a sign of a living democracy which should always test its limits."
People are freaking out because they keep lying and getting away with it.
"I mean... if there is proof out there that Hillary did something illegal, who cares where it came from? Russia is our ally (mostly)"
"Just an fyi, but ""Maine"" has an e on the end of it. Your description is missing one. :)"
"There is nothing illegal about gaining information from someone who has it, and every american has an interest in knowing what various politicians are up too, any journalist, any citizen, anyone at all in the whole world, could have a reasonable interest in that information. Nothing whatsoever illegal about setting up a meeting to get information. Conspiring to commit a crime =/= setting up a meeting with a lawyer to talk about information on a politician. 
For fuck sakes you folks should explain what you think is illegal so you can be revealed to know nothing."
Phil should win an award for least cancerous comment section on YouTube.
"I have a big dick. Now that can be interpret as 2 inch big, 6 inch big, 12 inch big or 20 inch big. 

All of the above can be true and false at the same time. 

And people that is what is wrong with the American language and its interpretation of its laws."
"I don't think you gave Deray Mckesson the complexity that he deserved. Yeah, maybe Deray was a little too over eager in seeing planet of the apes as a representation of the Black Lives Matter movement, but he has more than a right to be sensitive to potential slights against him; he is personally targeted over and over by Black Lives Matter critics. For example, one major thing that happened to Deray recently was being targeted by an NRA ad for no reason at all (which I wish you would have included - it gives a little context to Deray's state of mind). As the NRA boasts to be a civil rights organization fighting for the rights of gun owners, which is absolutely valid and their prerogative, this ad had absolutely nothing to do with guns or gun ownership or individual rights at all. The black community, with Deray a particular target as he is a leader in the black community, is so accustomed to being harshly and individually targeted that I don't really blame Deray for seeing this as one more thing targeting him and the movement at large."
how the fuck Germans formed anti nazi protest. you people were the Nazis. It's like Catholics protesting Christianity.
"6:12

"It's official, phill is trump supporter... sad day :("
Preaching tolerance with their fists....very true
Death to America
Again I think people need to stop being so dang sensitive. People take so much to heart nowadays even if it doesn't involve or interact with their thoughts and beliefs. People need to stop overanalyzing situations and be rational. (About the planet of the apes thing)
"i will never agree that passing on TRUE information that isn't privatized by the government is something bad to do. 
the truth should always be supported and allowed to be given out, if the truth came from russia and thats all that came from russia that doesn't really matter much. if what they gave was lies, thats actually bad. 
this whole Russia VS America thing is always pretty dumb the only times i will actually say Russia is being bad is when Russia is actually doing bad stuff, not just stuff that doesn't support what i want to happen."
G20 in Toronto most officers were being sued because they hurt free speech protestors including my father taking pictures. I was 12 and they actually gased the crowd. You would think they would have a solution by now.
Wow smh first piece reminds me of the sad lawsuit between GTA5 and Lyndsay Lohan

"Not to take a side on the Russian\Trump and Ukraine\CLinton bit, but who cares where information comes from so long as it is legitimate and verifiable?  I can see an issue if exchanges of favors for said information comes into play, that is coercion, but so often we here situations like the Hilary camp trying to dismiss the Wiki leaks  email fiasco because it was Russian hackers. I don't care if Adolf Hilter rose from the grave and handed me damning information, It is healthy to be skeptical of the information based on it's source, but if the information is true, regardless of the providers intent, the information is true. I would rather make an informed decision than an uninformed decision."
"guys, can we all just calm down and watch Doctor Who together?"
Did the Trump campaign get in contact with anybody that WASN'T Russian in the lead up the election and inauguration?
"To answer your question, in my opinion, I do think that it hurts your cause and discredits you to the majority to demonstrate ""irrational extremist"" thinking. 

That said, I also can see how it happens. You begin rallying for a cause in which you believe. The deeper into the cause you invest yourself, the more you hear stories of how this issue has affected the people within your movement. Everyone sees things differently and experiences things differently, and the more you empathize with them, the more pervasive of a light you see this issue in. So, eventually, you can see persecution almost everywhere because, if nothing else, people you care about perceive this as persecution due to their experiences, and you as sensitive to them. So, the more you empathize, the deeper you go. 

And, I do think is is also fair to note that we are viewing this as the outside majority unaffected by the plight of the movement. So, I absolutely agree that it discredits you to the majority. But should that matter? Should the value of your argument depend on how much outsiders can understand it? Human nature says you need a majority for change. But how much is it appropriate or fair to downplay and compromise to gain that majority support? 

The short answer moral of the story is, yes, once you get that far into an idea, it comes off as crazy and does discredit you when you then attempt to discuss your issue with that outside majority in the future."
"Narcissism, the new top of Cool!"
"11:11 You can't solicit when you are the one being solicited. Trump Jr. didn't reach out to these people, they sought him out! Can't believe you don't understand this."

"Maine* in the description, Phil :)"
"I don't understand how people are surprised that other people lie? Really? Especially when we are talking about power and money, come on guys, there's always some shady shit going on when power and money show up to the party. Did he brake the law, according to the letter of the law yes. Information that could cost a candidate the presidency is more valuable than any monetary donation could be. Don't try to literally interpret the law in one occasion and loosely in another, depending on your desired outcome."
"Did the lawyer offer illegally obtained information?
Did Donald Jr ask for Illegally obtained information? 
Did any party ask for or suggest political (or any) favors in exchange for information (collusion)?
No?
Well then fuck off, it's 100% legal. 

Collusion =/= getting information from people. Collusion is about COLLUDING, as in working with, quid pro quo, etc. WHICH DID NOT OCCUR. 

Did he lie? That depends if Donald Jr. really thought she worked for the Russian government (when he said ""Russians"", he was obviously talking about those in or directly connected to the Russian government.) I have no clue if he did or not, but at this time no one can.

Additionally, Donald Jr. was a private citizen at the time.  

If getting information about anyone campaigning from another nation's citizen is illegal than almost every presidency (and several news networks) would be guilty, which is obviously not the case."
YES!!!!!!!! Now we are talking! My 2 Favorite News Channel ak. WeAreChange and Philip DeFranco Together! <3
Philip there is one important thing you forgot to cover on the Hamburg protests. And that's the response of the local community. Who after the G20 summit came together to clean up their city. I know the protests both peaceful and violent were a part of the story. But so should the community response be. And it's a shame you didn't mention it
I may have committed some... light treason.
i hear theirs chimps in Africa... so racist. no its a fact you idiot
"This and many many other reasons is why there needs to be a cap on any spending for any political office.  The amount of moral people let alone politics make me ill.  As for orange bankruptcy expert and his family, again hope he is soon replaced with Pence so the office of the presidency and our country's reputation can begin to be repaired.  Thanks for the video Phil"
You can watch 100 hours of CNN and try to make sense of what's going on or you could watch 11 minutes of Philip DeFranco and know exactly what's going on.
"On DJT Jr. I think the statement ""two wrongs don't make a right."" is the most apt. By all means HIllary is leaps and bounds worse than this for these exact same things (Ukrain, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, name it) but that doesn't matter. The wrong was done here and should be handled the same. 

I'm most interested in the comment ""Russia's support for Trump"" 

I feel more context is required here. Is this evidence of collusion? Is this evidence of attempted collusion? Does Russia just like Trump but nothing substantial was exchanged? We need to know more."
"Funny how many of the left call those that disagree with their cause or have a different opinion to their ow call those people racist,  a Nazi, or sexist when they themselves are acting like fascists. Political Correctiness is just a modern day disguise for fascism."
Planet of the apes - If anything it promotes inclusion and highlights the danger of segregation as well as giving it the viewpoint of the persecuted. Im mixed race and honestly just get wrapped up in the film and respect the undertones as undertones.

"Emin Agalarov's father is not related to the government. Emin is a rich boy and is a singer, while his father is an Azerbaydzhan national (perhaps dual) but is more connected to Azerbaidzhan mob (allegedly) and is real estate tycoon in Moscow and Moscow region. I think this lawyer lady was trying to use this bait to get some questionable businessman like that of Magnitsky list but ultimately failed."
"The G20 ""protests"" should be called what they were: riots. You had thousands of people burning property, looting stores, and engaging in flagrant destructive behavior. During with roughly 400 police officers were injured while attempting to stop the violence with the minimum of force necessary. What happened there is getting ridiculously small news coverage, when it should be the eye opener to the world about what kind of hypocritical violent thugs Antifa really is."
"Ha! Deray thinks he's so important he's worth mocking? The persecussion delusion is impressive
Also these are not protests these are pain and simple riots"

"Did you call the philando castille shooting was unjustified? If you look at the footage and reasons it's a perfectly justified as he reached for his fucking weappn when the officer specifically told him not to and got shot for it. Come on man, don't drink the kool aid."
We impeached a president for cheating on his wife. I honestly don't understand how Trump is still the president after all he's done. And past presidents as well. They have done so many much worse things are still got their full term.
Fucking white people wearing shoes in the new spiderman movie.  So racist.  I am o-ffended.  Shut it down.  SHUT IT DAOWN!
"Yeah, thats not a protest phil THATS A FUCKING RIOT!"
"I usually don't get into the YouTube comments like this or anything, but I feel everybody needs to recognize that throwing a whole Group like BLM under the bus hasn't done anything to help anything, saying that all people who are a part of the BLM movement are terrorists because of a decent amount of violent A-holes is similar to saying that all people who supported the CRM were, in turn, a bunch of terrorists because a good bit of them participated in acts of violence, personally as a black male, I don't believe that it's fair to put us all in the same bus when we're going entirely different directions. I'm just trying to understand where people are coming from and standing with this"
I wonder why you didn't include Jr.'s response to the most incriminating email sent to him.
No secret link of the day? RIP
"You say you don't have a slant, but it sure seems you do when it comes to Trump news, you make it look like He or his people are somehow in the wrong."

"America has become a place where you are either ""this"" or ""that"" and its sickening. I did not vote for Trump and honestly, I can't stand him as a human being. However, I also don't agree with taking CNN or The New York Times as law. The facts are that most often then not, we don't get all the facts. To make a concrete opinion over something you don't actually know everything about seems off to me. It is up Americans to take everything we are presented with and make an opinion; not just everything we ""like""."
nazi swine said the german as he assaulted the innocent man
"The more the snowflakes protest being snowflakes, the more they prove they are snowflakes.

"Ok, admittedly, I don't know all the facts but it seems that the Hillary example might be a false analogy. Because, based on what you said, the Ukrainian government made its own choices to voice support by calling things out publicly, not by soliciting secret meetings and exchange between campaign officials and a foreign government. (Not proven, though) If a foreign government wants to publicly take a stance on an election, there's nothing that can stop them and it's hardly the fault of that candidate... right?"
"Don't know why that song surpassed Gangnam Style, it isn't even that catchy of a tune."
"I support BLM because when I'm a little old lady, I don't want to horrify my grandchildren when they learn I was against or irrelevant toward the civil rights movement generation of my generation. I refuse to be on the wrong side of history, and I recognize that a lot of the media coverage and arguments against BLM have severe racist, classist, and nationalist undertones. Police brutality has always been and continues to be a problem. THAT BEING SAID, Phil hits the nail on the head when he says ridiculous reaches like this only undermine that cause. Shame."
Liberals heads just keep spinning lol
"Phil, Antifa IS intolerant and violent. I wish they'd stop, but they won't."
"""it makes your cause seem violent"" 
IT IS VIOLENT!  Wake the fuck up."
Can we all just stfu about race already? How do you manage to care this much for this long? The more you feed the trolls the more shit they put out.
"Those ""freaking out"" are doing so mostly because Trump-bashing has become many people's favourite hobby (let's face it, it is kinda fun...and easy). Furthermore anything that could lead to impeachment or harm Trump's presidency is seen by many on the left as a holy grail (ignoring the fact that even IF trump were to be removed from office you'd be left with Pence, who is arguably even more vile/stupid/evil). People have also conflated collusion with impeachment, as if as soon as ""collusion"" is established that's it - TKO, game-over (this is incorrect). Its only clear significance is that for months now the DNC has obsessively and provocatively harped on about Russia (as if it's their only card), speculating on a connection between Trump's campaign and a foreign government (Russia) seeking to influence the campaign. The speculation is now over. There is now documentary evidence evidencing a Russian effort to help Trump and seeking to influence the election. Whether it was criminal or not (seems like an inchoate crime at best on current facts) on the part of Jnr remains to be seen."
"A few years ago I would have agreed with your statement of ""I hate nazis,¬†spit on nazis with words all day"" without a second thought. Now all nazi seems to mean is you disagree with my left leaning views and I want an excuse to not talk to you or to physically assault you. I can no longer agree with your statement unless it is previously specified that we are talking about the nazis from WWII."
Philando Castille was not unjustly shot!
Illuminati confirmed
hola
"Here's a lawyer saying that Trump Jr. broke no law: ""So listening to someone who claims to have evidence that a federal crime by your competitors is now an effort to defraud under 18 U.S.C. 371? I am highly skeptical of the chances of such a claim and I have never seen the like of it.  Others have suggested that he might be charged with ‚Äúviolating federal criminal statutes prohibiting solicitation or acceptance of anything of value from a foreign national.‚Äù  Well, business people accept things of value for foreign officials all the time. It is called transnational business. Presumably, this is meant to suggest a criminal contribution to a campaign from a foreign national ‚Äî ironically the very allegation raised by the Russian lawyer against Clinton as the purpose of the meeting.  That allegation is rather hard to square with the fact that campaign officials and candidates speak to foreign leaders and sources all the time on issues.  If notice of a possible crime or information is now deemed as thing of tangible value under federal campaign laws, the wide array of exchanges on behalf of campaign would be implicated. Indeed, major free speech and association issues would be raised.  Once again, this is a matter that is worthy of investigation. However, these possible criminal charges are radically over-extended on the facts that we currently have.""

"Unfortunately, there is a culture of people going to protests not to protest for what they believe is right, but instead go to these protests for the sole purpose of getting into fights, causing damage etc. All they care about is the thrill of causing damage."

this guy kept his emails... imagine what hillary deleted..
Republicans and Democrats are the same party putting on a big show. They don't care about you and I. They love it when they see videos debating which party is right or wrong because it gives them more confidence that the public has no clue of what's going on. PS: BLM leader needs to get out and spend time with some normal people. I can't imagine what his parents are like...
"Surely what's been released isn't the full story on Trump Jr. There's going to be more meetings come out, I'm sure"
"Spends 20 seconds talking about Hillary and her campaign. Then goes on to spend the rest of the time about Trump Jr. No bias there, just like when you always talk about her. Your latest Russian spy fetish is really starting to show Phil. 

It's funny how everyone is suddenly an expert on this law. When no previous examples are given to support the anti Trump agenda. It's another nothing story, and up being nothing. 

No mention the Russian lawyer being with the Obama staff, at hearings sitting with Obama groupies and democrats. If her visa was expired how did she meet with them in the building? Where is your outcry of emails chains involving her and the people she met with?"
I don't see it what's next tho GODZILLA IS RACIST!
Solid coverage Phil! Appreciate you honesty and fairness!
Really man. Nazi? Fuckin serious? That's insulting to compare normal people to Nazi's and disrespectful to Holocaust victims. That's like putting rape victims in the same category with girls who regret it later.
"Antifa are terrorists, period. According to title 18 part I chapter 113B section 2331 of the US code, international terrorism is defined as:

acts which involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State, or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or of any State;
(B) appear to be intended‚Äî
(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;
(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or
(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; etc

+Niko butts is right. This is not a peaceful protest, this is yet another example of far left antifa and friends trying to push their agenda and ideals through violence. These people are so far left, they do not believe in capitalism or democracy (two of the things that create this amazing country), many of them are even communists or sympathizers. Communism, like Fascism, is a totalitarian system of government which takes away all a basic human rights (of which America is built on). So while saying that antifa are fascists is not technically correct (because fascism is extreme right not left), they are fighting for Communism, which is just as bad as fascism.

These people have no argument, just violence. If they could explain why a style of government that has historically killed millions every time it is put into place is better than our democracy, that would be one thing. But instead they use force and scare tactics.

America's antifa shopping list:
Water cannon trucks (The Germans got one thing right)
Sandbag guns
More police presence at events like this 

And in case you're wondering, antifa is only capitalized at the beginning of the sentence, because terrorists don't deserve caps, much like adolf hitler.
OK rant over"
You suck

"While its been a year or two sence I've followed him and some of his beliefs were a bit to far for me, luke from we are change  was one of the most bad ass youtubers I've ever followed. Armed with a camera and a mic he would flash interview some of the most powerful people on the planet and ask them the most uncomfortable questions they would ever dream of being asked. And provided you are not one of the world's elite he seemed very loving and a great guy. Moral of the story, fuck anyone that would beat him up."
there was a lot of conversation about getting violent vs using words and intolerance etc when the whole punching nazis thing went down. is it okay to punch nazis or does that hurt the legitimacy of the antinazi movement?

I don't see how people who want to beat other people up hurt their own cause by beating up people
I feel like poc have started to go out of their way to be offended
+Philip DeFranco COMPLETELY DISAGREE with you on the importance of discovery in the Trump issue. I think We(freedom of speechers/anti-SJWs) need to hold the left pushing for this accountable and finish the Hillary and Sanders investigations FIRST. This is all a BS tactic to reduce gathering information on those two investigations. And unless we focus on pushing for the truth on those before this new Trump Jr silly-ness.... We will never get to the truth and expose the government corruption that was started by the people that were in power. It is far more important to me than someone who was involved with a campaign that was NOT in power doing something wrong.
I find it hilarious that a German antifa supporter/member is calling an American reporter a Nazi.
"and that Clinton did something wrong somehow makes something that Trump does less bad? ""BUT SHE ...!"" is such a kindergarden argument. if the only way to make what you did less bad is to point to what someone else did you really f'cked up"
Why are so many of your subscribers uneducated?
"i'm myself pretty left-leaning, but seeing protests turn into straight up riots like this always disgusts me. it just gives your opponent a reason to call your whole movement irrational and violent, and, which i find the most harmful, it makes protesting dangerous for peaceful demonstrators. someone, no matter which side they're on, who just wanted to make their voice heard might get hurt or might be to afraid to go protest because of you. in times like these it is especially important that people can go out and stand for their beliefs without having to fear getting hurt."
God people in these comments saying BLM are supremacists are exactly he issue Phil mentioned. He literally said people are gonna take this comment and delegitimize real social issues.
"i feel that investigating deeper into foreign collusion is fine as long as both sides are investigated. no one can pretend their side is perfect, when has their ever been a completely honest politician?"
I don't think the antifa Black Block people care if beating someone up or destroying something hurts their cause or not.
We should support anything BLM has to say regardless if it's right or wrong. They need our support.
I'm sorry I just can't take BLM seriously.

So Saudi Arabia donating millions to the Clinton campaign means nothing because she didn't win?
isn't it funny that Germans were calling people nazis?
Has any ginger haired or obese person complained about the fat orangutan in the movie?
Where's scarce?
"he calls it ""Much Ado About Nothing""...in the play, the villain is Don John...Don Jr...Don John...Coincidence? 
P.S I would like to say I'm joking and it is a total coincidence I just thought it was amusing :)"
"I'm sorry, am I missing something with trump jr's emails?  Why is everyone solely focusing on his involvement with the Russians (which they should be) but have mentioned nothing about the Russian's potential incriminating intelligence mentioned in these very same emails that Hillary may have colluded with the Russians?"
"I like how you took the time to try and disseminate and parse out the phrase ""some other thing of value"", and as an accounting student here's what they've taught us when it comes to parsing out perceived value in any transaction:

For something to have value, another person must be willing to pay for it without any pressures from the seller, this is known as Fair Market Value.  Intrinsically, for those documents to have monetary value, somebody else would have to have been willing to purchase those documents at a similar price.  Furthermore there was no negotiation of price or quid qo pro transactions instigated by the meeting.  In essence this means that there is no Fair Market Value associated with the information.

Back Tracking to your analogy at 8:46, I think it was inherently an unethical decision to even attempt to receive information from sources outside of the United States due to the obvious conflict of interests it represents.  

Tl:Dr: The info has no value because nobody else had an interest in buying it and no price was ever discussed, still fishy any way you slice the cake"
Sigh. Such sad lives these activist live.
Two Trump's don't make a right...
"We shall teach them our peaceful ways, BY FORCE!"
Where's the secret link of the day?!?! Did I miss the joke...
"I think you have it backwards Philip.  These violent protesters aren't simply people who are  overzealous about their cause.  They are violent people who have found a cause that justifies their desire to lash out against society.  The cause isn't the priority for these individuals, the violence is."
Trumps downfall.....the tiny blue bird
Deray is a narcissistic blowhard taking advantage of the deaths of others.
There's a white dot of lint or something in your hair lol sorry I had to
FUCK ANTIFA
yea we should have just talked hitler out of killing jews. Fucking liberal scum fuck you
Philip your not helping trying to make out that there is still such a thing as nazis.
I drank every time Trump was said now I'm dead from alcohol poisoning
Both Hillary and Trump are fucked up for letting foreign gov'ts try to tamper with our election.
Am I the only one that thinks most of the antifa/identitarian movement people just want excuses to cause chaos. They see this as a way to attack and hurt without responsibility. Maybe I just think this because I don't agree that many people value life so little.
"I just would like to add that no matter how low on the totem pole you are politically (say state assembly) people crawl out of the woodwork to present negative information on your opponent.  Some people take advantage of it some don't.  Since the beginning of this country (Try looking at the Andrew Jackson race of 1828) mudslinging your opponent has been part and parcel of a political race.  I don't know the mind of Donald Trump Jr., I do remember everyone from Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians and others who used every trick in the book to derail the presidential run of Donald Trump.  I remember the DNC paid an Ex-MI6 agent to find dirty material on Donald Trump that was handed to Sen. McCain who handed to the FBI who determined that it was inaccurate but then leaked it to the press, so I cut Donald Trump Jr. some slack in this matter.  But if we charge him, if his actions were illegal, then the DNC needs to be charged as well (including their tactics with Bernie Sanders)."
"This whole Russian thing has been so blown up over so many false cries about a wolf that even if there was something substantial then half the nation wouldn't believe it anyways. Truthfully, I'm one of those people. These liberal news outlets have been caught in so many fucking lies that I don't know what to believe anymore."
"If information is not value to you, I don't think you should work for government."
thank you for existing ‚ô°
"fuck that guy, it's a fucking movie about apes taking over the world, nothing is founded in reality"
"Black lives matter, cgi apes dont."
I thought Trump Jr. wasn't apart of the campaign though?
Where is the secret link? Is it invisible now? =)
"Phil i have been subscribed to you for quite a while now and I'm sadly unsubscribing, your coverage of the what you called 'protests' in Hamburg was so weak and unresarched. Also you rarely cover any news other then Trump or YouTuber 'news', I'm an Australian living in Germany and i can't depend on TV news to be exact and i thought i could depend on you but sadly not anymore. You probably won't even read this but I just wish you'd listen to your subscribers more and also be more exact when you give an opinion out and not be so light on big matters."
"I keep hearing people complain about antifa and how they like to punch neo nazis and set dumpsters on fire, but I hear VERY LITTLE about the terrible things that fascists and neo nazi's have done and stand for. Yeah, it's bad that the wrong people got caught up in this mess, and I don't condone violence or destroying public property, but the fascist, ultra right wing, white nationalist ethos scares me the most. Its like people are actually sympathizing with these monsters instead of openly condemning them just because some have taken a few lumps. The fuck is wrong with everybody?! 

How about a lot less of ""oh, those poor little fascist lambs are getting hurt by the big bad antifa!"" and more of ""they're both kooks with terrible beliefs and they need to stop."""
"I disagree with this guy typically, but at least he's an intelligent liberal who doesn't condone senseless violence against little blonde women."
"So basically some politicians in almost every society are corrupt to some extent. I feel like we've all known this for a long time, I just don't know what to do about it."
"Hey Phil, the ""crown prosecutor of Russia"" doesn't exist. Just sayin."
"Deray is bought and sold by Patagonia, T-Mobile, and Doritos.

THE REVOLUTION WILL BE SPONSORED BY CORPORATIONS!!!"
"Phil !!!! Maine is spelled ""Maine"" NOT ""Main"" please update the description!!!!"
"I have some serious concerns when it comes these constant clashes between crowds on both sides of the aisle. Masked people carrying bats, bike locks and pepper spray. Its not an ""if"" it happens....its a ""when"" somebody starts shooting into a crowd in one of these states that has very loose Stand Your Ground Laws."
I feel like Antifa is the KKK of our party.
"Come on Phil.... How is it soliciting when sd. he initiated the connection?  It was all her, sent first email asking for meeting.  He did not solicit her.  Showing your left side bud"
"Antifa are not ""fascists"". Their goal is globalised communism and will threaten anyone with violence in order to achieve it. They are anti-white, anti-family and pro anything that resembling destruction of Western culture. I prefer the term Communist Scum."
Don't be stupid.....Stupid.
"antifa are just a bunch of comunist douchebags there fucking dumbasses, Nazism isn't a massive problem"
defranco is such a total douchebag
15 cars were torched in my street last week in Hamburg. Got some of it on video. Police and Fire fighters didnt show up. Really a crazy weekend!
"i need the intro for my phone alerts

would be funny if it went off during a very serious meeting hahaha"
"I never comment but it is bothering me man, you spelled Maine as Main in your special links and my eyes are bleeding I am from Maine please"
"I would say ""other thing of value"" is intentionally written exactly this way to cover every situation it is intended to, including the situation we see here today with Trump Jr. The information had value."
I don't get why they are protesting it's just a meeting.
If someone has to where something to cover their face they're are not at an event to protest they're bat an event to riot.
"Philip, why are you so good at what you do???? very informative, thank you!!!"
Honestly I just can't get over the way you are saying Deray's name.  Emphasis should be on the second syllable.
"I have to take issue with the point you made today about hurting your cause by hurting others, although I believe this to be true in many cases, for Germans it is understandably not a case of pushing a cause. The violence towards those people was formed out of pure hatred due to the incredibly sensitive matter of nazism in Germany"
My friends who lives near the area of the protest has recently taken a small trip to berlin due to the large risk it is to stay in the area.
Where is the secret link?
LOL black people think they look like apes xDDDD
I wouldnt say fuck nazis i would say fuck nowaday nazis because back then when the nazis were in the war they were forced and didnt have any choice
"It is extremely alarming that ""anybody"" could take a photo or video of Philip DeFranco (or anyone else for that matter) out of its context and misconstrue and morph it to fit into their own agenda - and given the right formula of a community following, a hot current event, a lucky strike on going viral, etc... Philip's (or whoever is targeted) life could be in immediate danger all because of a single social media post that was liked/favorited on a massive scale. And it's alarming that we have all of these movies that teach us to be respectful, humble, kind, and forgiving, etc... that it's okay to have different views - but to not act on them negatively - and face to face people will smile and nod and say that these are good qualities in a person yet you throw a computer in front of them and that 'veil of anonymity' allows people to willingly strip away their masks of who they want to be projected as and they let their true colors show by saying & doing things that only divide us even more...

I don't understand the value to be gained from blasting people and being a part of a cause that is out to hurt someone.
Trust me, we are all humans and we all have our moments where we just want to see someone get obliterated like when the Hulk smashed Loki. But I myself, would never ever actually do it. Likewise, when I see content online that I don't agree with - I simply sigh and move on with my life. It's not worth getting caught up in something you don't have any pleasure or interest in. The only time it's fit for meddling into others lifestyles that you don't agree with is when they ask for a discussion and varying opinions. In that situation, yes go ahead... speak your mind...RESPECTFULLY. Say what you believe. Say what you agree with, what you disagree with, WHY you feel that way, WHAT you think could CHANGE to benefit ALL and thank those for reading your side of things and move on. I don't understand why people have to throw in incorrect facts or insults just to stir up a fight. Like you said, it only further harms your cause. If you want people to listen, you must also listen. Both parties must sit down and close your minds to outside influences. You must hear each other genuinely. Attempt to see from the others perspective and reasoning. Then, formulate your new thinking. Did your views stay completely the same after the discussion? Did they change a little more? Did  you realize any flaws or improvements to be made in your cause that the other shed some light on?

Criticism and being cynical are not bad things. They are very good tools when used properly. I wish people didn't take things so personally when being questioned or criticized but rather use that as their window of opportunity to explain themselves, their side of things, and hopefully those out there with their pitchforks and torches can truly comprehend what is being said and re-access the situation and put their weapons down and opt for love instead."
Phil is so lucky - he's met watsky!
"information is deff a ""thing of value""..."
This whole Trump Jr story has just cemented my view on Trump's election.... Well at least it's not us and at least we get some high quality entertainment up in here
"G20 always seems to bring all the trashy people to light. Lots of people who just want to riot, steal and destroy property and they use things like this g20 meeting as their excuse. Props to the peaceful protesters who spoke with signs instead of with their fists."
Tariq is a big racist.
no violence will not cause meaningful change in today's society. we don't need tolerance for an systematically intolerant system
Maybe the ape is a stand in or maybe he isn't. I can see either side but the truth is we won't know till the movie is out.
"Antifa is a cancer on the world. It should be treated like ISIS, and stamped out"
Sub for a sub back
I hate politicians.
"Oh noes... Our world is NOT black or white, it's fucking grey. But some people think that they are the right way... I say that: Nobodies is wrong, and everyone is right.
For exempel: If a ""nazi"" hurt someone, people gets angry, but if people hurt the ""nazi"", then it's ok? Of course not! Because all and all, and in the end, and bottom of this fact: People hurt people, no one is better and no one is worse."
"(Democratic Assumption: Everyone loves Hillary)¬†Hence,¬†SHE WOULD'VE WON if it wasn't for the Russians !!"
"You know the reason why I don't support shit is because extremists lurk everywhere. I'm so tired of the BLM movement and Antifa, I'm so tired of political parties and people taking themselves so seriously, but I also understand why people would want to be a part of something, it's just so childish when they start to turn violent for it though. For these reasons I don't vote, and I don't plan on doing shit. I'm just tired of all this bullshit. Go home already."
"Phil can you talk Justin trudeau and what hapened with the killing of the Canadian. also if possible can you talk about the Anonymous video about what happened, thanks."
"FUCK YEAH, WATSKY IS DOPE AS FUCK"

Deray and Tariq are race pimps.
It's weird that Charlie puth has less total views than see you again does
"Would Loooooove to see you cover the story coming out of Australia about the Police raid on a ""Sex Party"" that left 2 shot and in the hospital."
I love what you do! I JUST HATE THOSE PILLOWS!
I'm glad that some days you don't just jump right into it.
"I don't trust Goldstone, he sounds like someone who is deliberately trying to undermine the Trump presidency."
"""Preach tolerance with their fists.""
What a poetic description."
Trump is trash
Your trump jr coverage garners so much respect for your character. I am absolutely amazed and will advocate for your journalism
"I'm not 100% sure I could be wrong, but Don Jr wasn't officially a part of the Trump campaign so would those laws even apply to him? Also Jared disclosed this meeting for his security clearance back in January.  The whole thing just seem fishy all around."
"Perfect analogy with the ""coke deal"""
"It's very confusing about Donald Trump Jr.s emails.  First, the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, is not a 'Russian government lawyer', she's an adoption lawyer and does not work with the Russian government. Also, there is no such position as ""Crown Prosecutor' in Russia."
Charlie Puth didn't get that title from his own work though. He got famous off of Paul Walker's death.
Remember this....The Russians don't do something for nothing...This whole White House and its staff are dirty as hell...Trump needs to resign and end the turmoil and shame his family brings to the country.
"The Phillip Castille shooting was justified AND the jury agreed.  The MINORITY cop (Hispanic) was tried bu a jury of 8 whites, 2 blacks and 2 Hispanics."
Phil's lack of understanding around fascism and the history of destroying it is outstanding. Beat the living shit out of fascists stops fascists groups from rising. Fact.
The world will learn if our peaceful ways..... BY FORCE
"G20 was a riot. When more people are hurt than actual protests are had, that's a fucking riot. Burning and screaming and looting and beating and even eventually killing are not protests. Well, screaming can be. But not violence. Protests are peaceful. Disruptive, loud, but fucking peaceful. Antifa can get fucked. Fucking anarcho-commie scum, the lot of them.

As for Trump Jr.- Not sure what to say. It's shady as fuck, and not moral, but illegal? And moreso a reason to impeach Trump Sr? That's.. less apparent. My favourite moment was the journalist who worked on this having a fucking meltdown when Trump Jr. scooped him. Because hole fuck, it was glorious."
"""Honey, I know I went with the intentions of sleeping with her, but she only wanted to talk about babies."" -Donald Trump Jr.
They let her into Trump towers and 3 top government officials met with her, one of which is the Son of the president and all they talked about was adoption, lol."
there is enough racism in the world that you don't need to claim racism on on stupid shit.
"If I was walking around the street minding my own business and a bunch of people began pushing around and attacking me. I would view that as a ""fear for my life"" situation,  pull out my gun, and end each and every one of them by shooting out their kneecaps then calling an ambulance."
"LMFAO, What about all the Saudi money directly Given to Hillary Clinton foundation during the election? they better back off before the whole DNC goes to prison."
"Hey Philip, where is the secret link ??? :("
They are up in arms over the vest but they completely missed the first movie where they had a bunch of apes swinging from porch to porch chucking spears?  Apparently spear-chucking porch-monkeys < a blue puffy vest.
"I agree/disagree with your stance about protests vs. violent protests......do you really think 'peaceful protests' actually work? Has it made the world a better place? Truly? The issues they protest about have been going on for the last 50-60-100 years, and sure you bring awareness with cute little rhyming chants in a bullhorn with bongo-drums; but that's all it is, ""cute"". The real 'powers that be' look from on high and say, ""sure, let them have their pow-wow and pretend they have their freedoms to speak out. We're still going to put Trump in the White House and make him dismantle American infrastructure, and still give piss-poor police training so cops with shoot at anything"".......Those ""powers that be"" got it all figured out. Hippies can be ignored.

Now violence on the other hand is the key. Except no-one ""not even Antifa"", knows how to use it. People on that side of the issue, are stupid and become all instinct and no intelligence. Their message of frustrations want to escalate to something more severe' sending a REAL message. But it just winds up rioting, causing damage to property towards owners that have nothing to do with the issue in hand, ""Smash up a Mom n' Pop shop, whom the owners don't support Trump, but was targeted because no one likes Trump."" The message is lost, and Antifa become nothing but thugs (or terrorists).....BUT doesn't mean, the peaceful alternative is better, and doesn't mean the 'act' of violence can't have purpose either.

So if these ""acts of violence"" were more focused (re: tactical).....wouldn't/shouldn't you call it a ""revolution""?.....Wasn't that a big part of America's birth, that you all seem to take pride in? Where then it was to fight off the British monarchy, and now today we look for freedom from it's crony capitalism, corrupt puppet Presidents, and foreign influences?

tl;dr: don't sell yourself short with the violent alternatives of sending a message; it could save your life, and your way of life."
"Imbeciles see something not even remotely related to what they blather on about, and through the power of insane troll logic, make it something related to what they blather about. Now, people who don't/can't/won't think critically have jumped on the bandwagon. I weep for collective humanity."
"Hillary did a pretty similar thing with Ukraine, but so you see the lamestream media say anything about that?  Well, if we did, fake and biased news wouldn't be a problem."
"Philando's shooting was unjust. He was murdered. It's not Deray's argument, it was an unjust shooting any way you slice it. Labeling it as Deray's argument takes away from its power."
Philip there's proof that the lawyer thing was set up by the DNC to have a Russian collusion root why are you not talking about that
"there is no such thing as a ""Crown Prosecutor""  in Russia. I'm not a government expert and I saw that was a fake title, to begin with. vague comments are not a valuable item."
The Phillip DeTrump show! Never disappoints on his opinion of Trump!
"am i missing something...why is ""i like pina coladas"" liked?"
"2016 was a shit show, completely."
"While the news continues to focus on the whole Russian narrative other major issues in this country are ignored. The media is not doing anyone any favors by continually bringing this up. I'd rather talk about the epic drug problem and narcan shortage. The still failing government healthcare. Or the war on Christians in Syria and how were helping the rebels. 
This is why the media is hated. They push agendas instead of providing information."
"Can someone pls explain?
If the law states that it is prohibited to receive foreign donations why did every candidate in the last few years, maybe even decades, receive huge sums of money from various sheikhs and such and why was it okay?
Thanks."
"Can someone actually defend themselves without saying ""someone else did something worse!!!""?
Seriously guys it's childishüôÑ
Great video as always tho phil!"
"thats a good argument, Nazis should be punched buuuut.....? that in itself is nazi"
"I mean you go to Germany wearing an identirian shirt you probably going to meet stiff resistance. I mean the German people are still conscious of their past,some people would say that they shouldn't be sorry for the work of their predecessors and I agree most of the time but this is a country where the German identity has baggage"
"""Seems more and more these days, people are trying to preach tolerance with their fists""

That's the thing, they're not preaching tolerance in the situations against people they have deemed as being Nazis. As far as their argument and justification is concerned, zero tolerance for 'Nazis' hence why they don't use anything other than violence against them.

Which they were permitted to get away with in the past and so they continue... but now we can see just how this mentality can be taken to new levels, going after people without much else other than people saying 'Oh yeah, these guys are Nazis, go find them'

Oh the selfawareness they lack"
"It is much to do about nothing. Wikileaks already published Clinton's and the DNC's wrong doings by the time the meeting happened. No one believes the NYT. Fake news. I am happy people close to Trump were meeting with Russian officials. Much rather have the US fed government being friendly with the Russian government instead of the two point nuke missiles at one another and endangering the entire world. Been there, done that already. On the other side, of course the entire Trump family is mob connected. No one in NY real estate is not connected to the mob. And yes, the US president is not connected to the Russian mob (Putin). So what? Better than Hilary."
"Okay, wait, so the Russian lawyer brought up adoptions in the west? I'm a bit disappointed that wasn't a bigger talking point. The west is notorious for abusing adopted children, and Russia spoke out about this already. Rightfully so, it's disgusting too see such high rates of child abuse. It's something that is severely under reported, and I can see why this layer would trick people in power to talk about this. However she didn't use the right bait in this situation."
Hurting Antifa's cause? Really dude? They're a violent group of brainwashed terrorists and disrupters. Their cause is to beat people up and loot electronic stores for iPhones while they complain about capitalism. Bunch of dickwads that's what.
"I think Trump jr is almost definitely in the wrong here but as far as ""Trump colluding with Russia"" there is still no real concrete evidence. yes there's speculation but there's no hard pressed evidence saying this is what Russia did and this is how it changed the outcome. or in other words ""a nothing burger"". 

yeah it's still shitty that Trump jr did that but that level of corruption really is nothing compared to the things the Clinton campaign did."
"Funny how the reason Clinton lost was emails, and now this happening to Trump... The irony...
Everybody says that they voted for Trump cuz they thought both were bad, and that Trump was less bad. That just proves that the election was a popularity contest, and Trump was the more charismatic one."
"I'm just curious...
Where were those mythical ""Nazi-Schweine""?

Or maybe they were on this protest,
wearing masks..."
I've yet to see one Antifa guy I couldn't hold with one hand while bitch-slapping another.
So from now on movies with animals in it need to make the animal color pink or other color or its gonna be racist? Lol jk
"The Watsky thing is cool and all, but didn't that guy jump off a lighting rig and injure 2 people at Warped Tour?"
"Political dirt on an opponent is not the same as a ""coke deal"", Phil. lol Anyway, considering this Goldstone character is involved with the fake Trump dossier and his oddly specific email saying she was working for the Russian government  (when she wasn't) and having info on Hillary Clinton when she really wanted to talk about removing the ban on Russian adoptions in the US makes me think this was a set up. Considering this was several months before the whole fake ""Russian collusion"" narrative took off it looks like this was the first step in attempting to creating that  narrative. This was probably going to be used by the Clinton campaign against President Trump before the election but they decided not to because they believed the fake polls which said Hillary would win in a landslide. Also, it could have led  to Hillary's proven involvement and collusion with the Ukrainian government that 99% of the fake news media won't report except for Politico."
"I'm always really hesitant to roll my eyes at something being labelled racist - I feel as though I'm not in a position to judge what is and isn't racist as a white girl. However, even I think that's a little crazy!"
holy fucking shit Philly d just brought up Watsky. I am dead.
Double nothing burger with cheese please.
"I shouldn't say this, but i'm glad the guy from 'we are change' got hurt
I was subed to him for 2 months, and in that time i could clearly see
this guy is just a fear monger, who just spouts off his own opinion and plays the victim card.
(claims he's the REAL news)"
"If you watch the trailer and other footage for War for the Planet of the Apes, the ape, known as ""Bad Ape,"" wears a blue vest and a winter coat in different scenes. He does this because he is old. His body cannot handle the cold temperatures like the other apes can as this movie takes place during the winter season. I still don't understand why Black Live Matter supporters are freaking out about this. Either they are intentionally putting the movie out of context to affect ticket sales or they are just ignorant of the situation.¬†The movie is in no way trying to offend black people."
"Hillary Clinton is on record getting donations from Saudi Arabia, this should be investigated the same as Trump"
What is most telling (and curious) to me is the fact that a young black man should be so quick to assume an ape is supposed to be a portrayal of them in a movie!?  And why would the makers of a big budget movie even know who the guy is? Let alone portray him as an ape!? There seems to be a lot of professionally offended people in general nowadays..
"In this comment section""But Hillary's emails, benghazi and stuff!!!"" Seriously? A wrong doesn't cancel out a wrong , that's not the way this works. You want people working in our government actively undermining our own political process? Y'all are braindead if you truly think what Jr did is okay because ""BUT HILLARY"", no body likes Hillary and guess what, she ain't president!"
"They weren't protestors it was the largest anarchist black block ever, don't defend them."
I hate when people turn a simple problem that can be easily solved into a complex problem with many problems that has no connection to a solution. example this comment.
"That's a whole lot of reaching by the Left, the law they believe was broken relates to money of goods being traded for favors, re. money and valuables. Not only is information not part of this, there was no talk about this being a trade for favors, as nothing was asked for in return. While this doesn't look good morally, it isn't illegal. However, what Hillary did, trading uranium to Russia, IS illegal. This is what this is really about, a diversion to keep the Clinton Foundation from being strung up for trading nuclear materials."
"Hey Phil, just want to point out one more, for me very important but missing fact to the G20 ""Youtuber Hunting"" that happened. The Antfa group did not get Lauren Southerns photo from anywhere but from a german journalist working for ""Die Zeit"" (Times). I dont want to provide his name here to prevent further outlash but I can backup my story. He took the photo, identified the people on there (not only Lauren) and published it to Antifa. Antifa retweeted the photo and asked other people to call out their location whereever they are. I just can't imagine the horrors: Trapped in a burning city, running, hiding, be aware of attacks. There is no - absolutliy no justification to do something like this. What if they would have been actually trapped and killed by extremists? This event just went so much over the top. Politicans actually have an argument now to throw down the leftwing..."
I hate SJWs as much as I hate Drumpf supporters.  Stupid people on both sides.
in a court of common law information cannot be used as something valuable
There's no secret link of the day today...
"meeting with a person from russia isn't illegal.. especially for a private citizen.. how stupid is this shit

its not a fucking coke deal."
"information is indeed considered a ""thing of value"" you can buy and sell information you can distribute information. information is just as valuable as the Mona Lisa if you consider the content"
What have we become :(
"How many extra migrants could be just out there raiding stores for valuables to sell, later on take those euros for food. G20 should be not in big cities maybe; wouldn't they be able to see this happening like a 100 yr flood plain"
This is a prime example of the hyper sensitive micro aggression ideology  ... the radical left doesn't seem to understand that this type of shit hurts what ever they're trying to do.
I don't like Trump Jr. he is a dick that keeps killing off endangered animals. (Like the last black female Rhino)
Classic case of losing credibility when you try to see bigotry in everything. Bigotry is a big problem but not everyone is bigoted
"Notice the extra fuck standing off to the right side of the reporter just he got pushed; it a good thing the camera caught that. Thee extra guy was ready to let loose a left sucker punch; thats a douche bag. Catch any fist with your elbow bet they won't throw punches, you don't have to hit anybody but you certainly can defend yourself. Sorry isnt going to save you; enemies with broken hands won't fight you"
"I read the email chain in the complete opposite order.. according to the time stamps, the ones that appeared first were actually sent last because that's how email replies are formatted. Don't know if this changes anything about the story, just wondering if I read it right"
"Thank you for reporting on the protests, I was unsure why you didn't do that yesterday"
"I must say, I'm glad trump got voted as president but now everyone have to end his ruling time and let anyone with better responsible take over and i think trump agrees with me on my opinion because he wants to go back to his bussiness and have time to do whatever he wants to do."
ANTIFA are domestic terrorists. That is all.
"In all honesty - What ""Cause""?"
"Blue vest??! Hellooooo, McFlyyyy!!!"
Whoa those protesters are going way too far!!
BLM are a bunch of racists
"Blm is irritaing. All lives matter just as irritating. Everyones confirmation bias....The frosting on the 
cake. Good luck finding the middle."
"There is NO guilt because ""collusion"" isn't a crime! lol Yes people, it's actually not illegal to talk to people from Russia! Did you fckers really not know that already?"
"Hey there Phil as far as I know Lauren didn't even realise that her shirt had the white (identitarian?) logos on it and she expressed guilt over ""causing"" the attacks on te other reporters. I also believe she isn't even a Nazi she's a libertarian completely against the authoritarian ideals of a Nazi and she only preaches major caution with mass migration she dosent come off to me as a Nazi with racially driven arguments. Kinda shows how crazy Antifa are..."
i only watch bc i need real news
"Oh, you like to ""spit on Nazis all day"", right?
Well, I want to see you spitting on Antifa, since I cant find no other ""Nazis"" anywhere....."
"blm is very ridiculous at this point, it also tends to be super racist now a days........"
lauren southern isn't a fucking nazi...................
I wish we just had a giant reset button for both sides of government I'm so tired of these criminals
"Those people don't hurt their cause since they have no cause, they are professionally paid protesters. They are the same people we see over and over in a ton of protest / riot whatever the cause or the location is."
Talk about the chessa push in Jake Paul's video from July 11th 2017
"People try their absolute hardest to blame a man's murder back onto himself. Yay, internet is fun."
So what's a Derray?
"Yes what Deray said was stupid and he should've held his tongue and maybe doe more research into the planet of the apes but everyone is human, everyone makes mistakes. He's a BLM activist and should be taken seriously when he talks about serious issues within the community. I don't think doing/saying something stupid but with possible good intentions should take away from your overall message. I personally don't know much about Deray but from looking at his page he seems to just trying to do some good by spreading awareness to many situations."
"Trump Jr.:  There is no law broken here because according to MANY other legal experts, it would require a significant broadening of the campaign finance law.  We also know for a fact that the Clinton campaign received the exact same thing from another country.  So it can't be do as I say, not as I do.  That said, this is clearly going to be a jumping off point for even more rabid reactions from the left regarding Trump.  I didn't support Trump in the election, but I sure as hell love how all these attacks on Trump end up revealing how the left has been doing the exact same thing for long time in many of the cases."
i dont mean to be that guy..... but is any one else sick of hearin about lauren getting attacked? i mean this is like the 3rd r 4th different time now. kinda starting to feel like its their victam card....get the nice cute chick to go out a get hit or pissed on. would we care as much if it was a big fat guy with a beard? defo their go to victam card.
Antifa needs to just die already.
Can you cover the Masterbation video on Cut?  Disgusting child abuse on young kids. So sick of this absurd sexualization on children allowed to exist on YouTube!  That video on YT had thousands of child abuse flags and it's STILL up and was even trending. How can this be allowed and trending in YouTube but normal channels get flagged and refunded immediately for venturing outside of the groupthink?
Thanks Phil for bringing sense into the discussions.
You said secret link... yet there is not secret link... are you keeping it a secret?
Why are people worried about the emails? What he did wasn't illegal

"Err this thing with the planet of the apes. Never heard of the guy before, if I was to watch the film (probably along with most of the UK and possibly Europe), all we'd see is an ape with a blue coat on."
no secret link though... shame!
"who thinks we should be tolerant for nazis?? this is a thing? Mate sorry, but Imma fuck some nazis up whenever I see them... The question is why don't you feel this way?"
"The part you're missing Phil is that Don Jr is a private citizen and can associate freely with whoever he wishes. It also is not illegal to meet with foreign nationals who might have dirt on your political opponents, otherwise Hillary should be under investigation from ""colluding"" (keeping with the spirit here) with Ukraine when they did the same with info on Paul Manafort."
"You're showing up with inflamatory shirts on purpose during a protest that you KNOW is going to be heated. Even if 0.1% of people present is going to be violent (and you will find that 0.1% in ANY CROWD OF PEOPLE) you are being IRRESPONSIBLE. The irony is that Lauren Sauthern is one of those ""Oh women shouldnt be wearing this and that if they don't want the attention"". Anyway. Looking forward to attend to a Christian Meeting with a t-shirt that says ""SATAN IS MY SAVIOUR"" and get the same coverage they're getting. And having ALL christians pass as violent people."
"""I hate nazis"" assaults people that disagree with them"
"As far as I know, Identitarian is just a fancy way of saying ""racist""
Does Southern really support that?¬† The videos of hers I've seen have been right wing, but not racist."
"It is so easy for movements that start with legitimate important issues to fall into the ""drunk with power"" momentum. The Russian & French Revolutions being perfect examples of ""Liberty, Equality, & Fraternity"" turning into the murder of hundreds of thousands of innocents who were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time and had done nothing wrong. The genius of Martin Luther King was appealing to everyone's instinct for decency instead of power."

Just arrest trump and Hillary. Fuck both of them
Hamburg G20 rioters all belong in prison for a long time. I would have sent in the military with tanks and such. Let the soldiers use live ammo to shoot the antifa terrorists. After the first dozen dead antifa scumsbags the rest will run in fear
Phillip can you talk about the Vatican swarmed with pedophiles and gay sex orgies next.
"It's funny that the ones calling people Nazis are often doing the things that the Nazi party did before it took power forming gangs beating people up ect... fighting hate with hate doesn't work, extremism on both sides is wrong and just getting stupid"
I'm fucking done with people. Give the apes their puffy vests and let them try to run things for a while. #apesforpresident
"The problem with this G20 was that did it in the middle of Hamburg, for those of you that don't know Hamburg is one of the most left cities in Germany, for example the Chaos Computer Club was created there (arguably the origins of Wikileaks and Anonymous). What also didn't help that the headquarters of a quite big left group was about 150 meters away. This is not to defend the action of the idiots of the Antifa, although it has to be remembered that most Antifa Members prefer peaceful protest.
But seriously they knew there was going to be some violent protest, and they did it anyway in the god damn middle of of a large city where they knew a lot of people's livelihood  would be destroyed. What the hell, did they want this to happen? Or are they really that stupid?
This was a recipe for disaster on both sides, the cops annoyed at the violent protester went and beat the shit out of peaceful protesters and what the Schwarzer Block (the aggressive ""I just want to fuck shit up and throw rocks at cops"" part of Antifa) did we all saw. 
This was stupid and unnecessary, and most annoyingly easily prevented, it just divides the line further and the only one who gains are the people who want to fuck us royally.  The Antifa can be a force for good and has been, people should unite and defend democracy and their interest in as peaceful of a way as possible.

"Narcissists, thinking everything is about them..."
I love this show so much. I wait for it everyday at the same time. I like it for real life stories or funny things like the lele pons story or that horrible story about the officer shooting the dogs. But the political stories sometimes don't really seem to be about anything important end up taking up half the show and I'm left there scratching my head trying to figure out what is going on and why I should care.
Im completely over this Russia shit ü§¢ just tired of hearing about it!
These people are idoits you dont need to watch the movies to understand that its not racist. I think the blue vest shows that the apes have taken over the humans spot not completely destroy what humans have done
To be honest getting everyday news from Trump kinds gets on my nervs now is there nothing to report repeatedly other than Trump? Can you now leave it to 3-4 Times a week? Like damn all u report abt him is crap anyways and its not like such big news that everyone has to know...
"Already been through months of ""did you talk to a Russian"". Doesn't matter, not illegal. (thanks for that CNN)"
"Liberals are funny.

Hillary deletes over 30,000 emails from her illegal server and is proven to have put classified data at risk several times and yet she's totally worthy of the highest office but Don Jr emails a crackpot Russian lawyer and this is stone cold, irrefutable proof of collusion between the Trump Camp and Russia?

I really can't comprehend the level of mental gymnastics required to make that an even slight feasible argument."
"I live in Germany, and I'm so fucking sorry for those fucking retards doing retard stuff. Just note, don't judge the mass by exceptions."
Whats the deal with this Blue Whale game that teens are playing now?
How does this channel get so many views nigga wtf
NOOOOOOOOO I fucking hate the song see you again. It's so fucking annoying OMG
"I don't know how often this happens in other countries but in my country, Mexico, when there is a protest, whether it be dumb or good, the government sends out some people that start rioting to make the protest and protesters look bad and sometimes the protesters also join in. It doesn't happen every time but it does happen most of the time."
"some of us plan an attending more of these type of protests to represent the right

we will be armed"
"I think Trump is actually correct in saying that this is a witch hunt. However, I am not sure if the witch hunt is necessarily unfounded. Granted that a bunch of, particularly, young democrats are mad that their horse didn't win the race and are simply bitter, there does seem to be some legitimacy to collusion. With the world becoming more connected today it is becoming easier and easier to do stuff like this, so putting our foot down now might be the best move in the long run. With that said, if Hillary was elected, I'm sure that we would have heard a similar story with just different actors."
how does a movie about chemically smart apes have anything to do with black lives matter if that's the case I think we all would've found the signs years ago...
Phillip don't be dumb.  HRC has already committed every crime that you were implying Trump Jr was attempting. Btw Trump Jr is a private citizen. I think he can have lunch with who ever it is he wants. Are you pro murdering lying cheating HRC?

Yess stranger things released on my birthday
"I will say again, why are we upset that ANYONE gave us the truth?  No one is disputing any of the emails that were hacked.  In this case nothing was given, but in others, the truth was exposed so why are we upset. Not one member of the DNC or the Democratic Race, or Hillary's team is disputing the validity of the information exposed under pain of perjury.  So why are we not thanking the Russians. Also I am wondering why are we still considering Russia an enemy?  Haven't they been a democracy for some time now?  If election watchdogs found their elections to be rigged, would not the world be unwilling to recognize Putin as president?"
Black lives don't matter
I enjoy watching your videos. I find your enthusiasm genuine while discussing your topics. The way you carry yourself make you as an author credible and believable. It is hard not to feel happy while watching your videos or commentary.
"Woha, I though Despacito already passed Gangnam Style."
the funniest thing is that we are all apes. Apes are so funny.
Ukraine also allegedly tried to interfere with our elections?!?!?!  Holy crap!!!  We need to treat all offending countries similarly.  Where were the sanctions from the Obama administration against Ukraine?  Drain the swap does mean drain the entire swap.  If only Trump would actually care.
"''liberals are reasonable, we just want a conversation'', yeah right my ass the second someone expresses an idea foreign to theirs they just start being violent"
TIL Phil is a Watsky fan and nothing has made me happier
"Philando Castile? 
Wait is that the guy that told the Hispanic cop he had a gun then started to reach for it and the cop told him not to multiple times? And he continued to reach for it? Then people blew it up saying it was racist and that it was a unjustified shooting? 
That guy?"

victim complex fucks
The ... Why people are FREAKING OUT.. podcast lol great content but the titles seems like they came off of a gossip tabloid.
"What I really want people to know, something no one I feel has mentioned, is that this did not involve pres. Trump, only Trump Jr. It's not like Trump Sr. wanted this all to happen. He is innocent in this regard."
"LOL ""We tried to collude, but we couldn't figure it out!"" üòÇ"
Holy jump cuts batman. Can't handle it. Unsubscribed.
"Although the optics don't look good for Donald Trump Jr, it's still not collusion."
"He totally owns wearing blue vests.  Yes.  It's logical, don't argue."
Trump and his family made the cardinal error of making the wrong enemy. Coercing the media was a big mistake among many.
"Antifa is evil & hypocritical.  They are trying to stop fascist movements because of how Germany lethally treated other races.  However, Antifa, if in power, would do the same thing to people ACCUSED of thinking that white race groups should be afforded the same opportunity that other race groups have to promote themselves.  (Just to be clear: People doing NAZI salutes can eat turd-coated cyanide capsule.)"
dammit phil make a shirt that says POLITICS because idk much about them tbh
"I'm not saying it's ok to attack people, but wearing a shirt like that is pretty stupid. It's like being a black guy turning up to a KKK rally. Yes it's wrong if they attack you, but it's still kinda your fault if you get attacked."
unjust shooting of Castille? are you kidding me? maybe don't inject your opinion in everything
GOSPEL! PREACH!
"The Trump email thing seems overblown to me ...

Maybe I'm just cynical but I'm of the opinion that the vast majority of politicians would meet with anyone if they thought they could get dirt on their opponent; and almost no politicians are moral/ethical enough to care about how the information was received. I'm pretty sure that most politicians would find it acceptable to waterboard kittens if it meant that they had a 1% increase in their polling numbers.

What I do think this demonstrates is that the past 6 months of the Trump/Russia coverage by organizations like CNN is overblown. If Trump Jr is meeting with random lawyers from Russia to get supposed intelligence from Russian hacking it doesn't seem likely that there is an official arrangement between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Basically, since day one we have known that Putin (really) dislikes Hillary Clinton and there has been no evidence provided that he needed any other reason to influence the election. In my opinion, it seems like the people who propped her campaign up are trying to find some reason besides her being a horrible candidate with a ton of baggage (including being hated by foreign leaders) for her losing the election."
"this is why I unsubscribed to this channel. its a waste of time rehashing of stupid news, spliced with advertisements."
Tariq Nasheed is the biggest racist out there.  Referencing him at any time is publicity he doesn't deserve.
I lowkey think your racist brah
"They should be arrested but nothing will come from this investigation. It's a waste.  You're right as soon as this is finished they should looking into the Clinton's and the Ukraine. 

Meanwhile Net neutrality is on its way out and people are ok with it"
Every time Lauren southern goes to an event she gets attacked in some way shape or form. You would think that rebel media would send someone else by now.
You incorrectly assume that antifa is for tolerance.  They are violent facists in all but name.
Oh hey! Maine is in a DeFranco video! Yay for my home state not being in there for LePage related reasons!
Were they actually protesters or only a sub group of people who used the protest to their advantage to cause harm and damage (i.e. not really trying to have their voice heard)?
I find myself getting frustrated with the black lives matter movement. The intentions/ foundation of the movement is justified and the issues need to be dealt with and talked about (there is racial discrimination) . But when you have someone that is seen as an advocate for the movement jump on a band wagon that really didn't exist in the first place my frustration only increases.
"I thought all governments try to influence other countries elections. if so why is bush, Clinton, bush, Obama, and Clinton not investigated? you can see where we meddle in other governments affairs all the time. what's the difference between this president and past?"
"what many don't seem to get is that there were so many different demonstrations, some against Putin's Anit gay laws, some against trump, some against Merkels policies etc. and then there's Antifa...
I think the violence, anarchy symbols and general attitude speaks for itself, in any case they're idiots. But then again, you can't not let them organise protests, and the police realized they were extreme, they just underestimated that there were left extremists flying in, and how violent they would be."
"WTF is ""identaterian""?"
"To that random German guy pushing that otherguy while saying ""Nazi Schwein,"" do you know who else did stuff juuuust like that?  The Ordnungspolizei."
"Philip you spelled Maine wrong in the down below link, I'm sure it was just a typo but heads up :D"
"Even if Trump and his campaign 100% colluded with Russia and violated U.S. Federal laws, hacked the election, and stomped all over the U.S. Constitution... Trump supporters don't care.
They. Just. Don't. Care.

Now please let Trump get back to fucking up the country beyond repair."
Lol I've never heard Gangnam Style  pronounced like that Phil. Sounds like you tried to say Gundam xD

"So just a thought on the last 5 mins. If they decide to make a case against Trump Jr. does that mean that Hillary Clinton, also named in the email committing the same crimes, will also be prosecuted?¬†And won't it be even bigger news that the President-elect during the campaign ALREADY did what Trump Jr., the elects son and in no way connected as close as Hillary at the time, couldn't successfully do and still lost. Why is Hillary not the bigger story from all this? Did she not also get accused while holding a higher seat of power than President Trumps son at that time?"

I did and then they let me know that they couldn't use the hair...just saying a lot of places that do the hair donation thing don't really explain that your hair needs to be a certain way."
That dude probably just wanted to make sure Watsky doesn't try to jump into the crowd again.

Friends and family of mine are living in Hamburg and they told me, that these people turned the streets into a war zone. 
But the people from Hamburg are showing so much solidarity, while the are cleaning up this mess.

"If someone's opinion on BLM or the Philando Castille shooting is so malleable that it is swayed one way or the other by Deray's opinion on a movie... sheesh. There's so much information and reasoned opinions (Deray even has many of these if you looks past his taste in film) on the subjects that if we start discrediting his thoughts on the whole based on these tweets, I think we're doing ourselves and the public discourse a disservice. Knee-jerk, emotional responses are no way to have a conversation - something both sides could stand to remember."
How did the NY Times get a hold of Trump Jr.'s emails BEFORE he released them on his twitter? Was he hacked?
"I think most of the world agrees to hate nazis as a baseline. As you say, verbally spit on them in a heartbeat. 

I've never really thought about it until now, but maybe the world needs to rethink that position. 

Not that we should reconsider nazi ideals, but that hating the label is dangerous given the amount of metaphorical label-makers in the world today. It gives rise to idiotic groups like Antifa, who are so intellectually stunted that they believe fascism makes sense as long as it's against fascists. 

I realize it's probably fruitless, but I'm going to stop saying or agreeing that I hate nazis. Instead, I'm going to assert that I hate the idea that violent coercion is an acceptable approach to dealing with your opposition. It takes a lot longer to print out that label, and it's much harder to get it to stick to someone. In reality, nazis suck, but as long as that's a label being applied to people to justify violence, I won't use it."
"Im never sure if most of the people in these antifa groups actually understand what Nazism and Fascism is or if they just use the labels to target people. Either way they are mostly really dumb, mentally ill and just garbage people."

BLM are narcisstic fucks who thinks everything is about them
I grew up watching planet of the apes and I enjoyed them because it's a science fiction story about humanity and the possible future evolution of our closest relative. To say that it's meant to be racist just boggles my mind. It's a story about learning how to cooperate and how about we take a lesson from the message of the movies instead of seeing things that aren't actually there. I agree Phil. Doesn't further the heart and cause that's behind BLM.
"Philip DeFranco. I dont think you know what kind of people we are dealing with here in Europe. Its the bottom of the barrel-people. small minded  and stupid people with no common sense, and no feeling of  unification towards ANYONE with a brain.

"The Castil shooting is highly conterversial.

Castil and his girlfriend matched the description of 2 suspects rom a robbery that took place nearby that day. There are recordings proving that.
Castil reached near his hip, where his gun was, to grab his ID, the officer go spooked and shot him.

They both fucked up. But it's definitely not because the officer is a black hating white supremacist who was out there to get black people, like BLM made it look.

BLM is a racist terror organization. They are pretty much apes, not because they're black, but because they're barbaric and stupid and cannot be reasoned with."
"For every protest, they should get¬†a guy/girl with training in hand-to-hand combat to wear something stupid that shouldn't represent a person & see if those idiots attack them. Just so those idiots¬†get their asses kicked for jumping to conclusions."
Deray is pronounced Dee- Ray #PSA
Ronald Reagan is rolling over in his grave the way that the current Republicans are sweeping this stuff under the rug. What has happened to the Republican party?

I am FREAKING OUT over how you're FREAKING OUT every other day in your titles about people FREAKING OUT about stuff. Is this your go-to clickbait? Like every 3rd-4th video seems to have this in the title.

Remember what is under investigation is a conspiracy to release the truth that the DNC fixed the primary so Hillary could beat Bearnie and that Hillary was helped by CNN in the debates.
They werent just calling him nazi they were calling him nazi pig
"So is it fine that Trump jr. sayed that he didn't get secret material from Russia because he could't find anyhing usefull, NOT because it would have been wrong. Even if what he did was not agaist the law, I feel like it that does not look good on him. It is like a criminall who didn't broke to the house because in the planing phase it came clear that security was too hard."
OK so maybe this one video of gangnam style doesn't have the most views. But there are like 3 videos and the other two also have like 100million

"The Dems and the Lefty voters WILL NEVER EVER look in the direction of Clinton, Ukraine and The Saudis, Even if they got what they wanted out of the Russia Trump bullshit. That is why people bring it up as a defense, cause they KNOW they'll never look the other way in a million years."
"It's the left, time and time again that are being the most violent and hateful.   Their side are the enemy to America.  Never allow them to win."
"No wonder Trump was paranoid his tower was tapped by Obama, also explains why they wanted those back channels so badly. Which, I believe Kushner was in charge of organising."

"1) Youtubers attacked? The attention seeking scum deserved it and more.
2) The whole ""black ape"" thing is pathetic from another attention seeker.

"Aggression against fascist is not happening in an vacuum(thou in this case it was wrong!). People identifying as ""identitarian"" are firebombing refugee-asylums by the hundreds, killing and harassing immigrates and who ever they define as collaborators. Going to a leftist protest with symbolism like that is going to provoke people, they know that and got what they wanted. By experience these people could have been armed and posed a serious threat, fascists killing people in Germany is not an ""historical fact"", its a current fact The NSU for example. Killing ten immigrates and two bombing attacks. The Ut√∂ya attacks in Norway killing 77 people, mostly children, he identified as ""identitarian""."
awesome stuff thanks

"I hate Lauren Southern. I hate everything she stands for, I think her arguments are not only factually duplicitous but also damaging to the overall conversation, and finally I think that she has such a complete lack of understanding of just about everything, that I think she has no part in engaging in the conversations she engages in.
So, you can imagine it takes something pretty severe for someone to do to her for me to stand with her and acknowledge that it was unjustified. Stalking and attacking someone isn't just unjustified; it's a horrible thing to do to a person. Find another way to vent your anger, okay? Me understanding the anger doesn't mean I don't condemn some of the ways of venting the anger."
"From what I've heard more of the police at those protests were hospitalized than the protestors! I think the police there did the best they could given the fact that an organized group of domestic terrorists showed up in force to cause mayhem. It's high time that Antifa were met with armed police and declared an outlawed movement internationally. Dressed in black, masked faces, carrying weapons and causing as much damage to people and property as they can because they hate everything our society stands for and want to replace it with our own, all the while benefiting from it... As Sargon says, there's no difference between Antifa and ISIS! Ban their attire at protests, arrest all who show up and give 'em harsh sentences, THEN we can see a return to peaceful protest again."
Lock Them Both Up!
"A Russian diplomat, high up in the Russian government, contacted Trump Jr. and said ""The Kremlin has dirt on Clinton and wants to help your father win""

Ah race-baiting by the persecuted. Awesome way to get people on your side by making something out of nothing.
I thought this guy  quit youtube what the fuck

"Antifa is nothing but an extremist communist terrorist organization comprised of human garbage with no concept of the value of human life. these people are wastes of skin and they shouldn't be treated with any respect. the only thing they do is loot, dox and assault people for having different opinions than them.
you're not a hardcore Social justice warrior and Hillary supporter? you're immediately a ''nazi-schwein''
these people have proven time and time and time and time and time and time again that they do not want an open discussion, that they do not want their beliefs challenged. and that they hate freedom and western values. their only argument is beating people over the head with bikelocks.
terrorist human garbage that needs to be treated as such."

why this asshole always on my recommendation?
where did the secret link go?
"You know what really gets me about the Trump Jr emails? If this were Hilary and this very same thing happened with Chelsea, the Republicans would be trying to have Hilary and Chelsea locked up so fast, and they would be screaming at the top of their lungs along with Trump about ""locking them up""! You know that ole' saying ""when the tables turn""....that applies to this ""administration""!

The source is irrelevant if the crime is real. What you call collusion is simple everyday politics.

You hate Nazis do you! Do you know any? Or are you just being the same as the rest of these paranoid fuckwits.
the YouTubers/journalist being attack was an act to censor the coverage of the event
"we talk so much about Nazis, where are they are they like fairies or bigfoot, seriously where are they."
"I am going to depart from my usual stance here.  While I applauded Richard Spencer getting punched, that was Richard Spencer getting punched while he was saying 'America belongs to white men' because there is no calm response to that.  But taking the behavior after the fact and telling people to harrass others even verbally is a problem the left has to work on, because you don't know what other people have already done and you can't take everything some rando on the internet said at face value, there might be missing context or the callout could be a complete fabrication."
"I don't understand why people think it's bad to punch nazis ?? Like if people like Richard spencer advocate violence against minorities, why can't we fight back. It's the American thing to do. All the veterans that right wingers talk so fondly about punched nazis. And don't give me freedom of speech crap y'all love freedom of speech until it's in the form of a left wing protest and not some racist troll preaching backwards ideology."
"You know MLK was thought to be crazy for saying the FBI is tracing him and following him and his family.  You're just not that important, people said, hmm years later we found out different.

How dare the the Russians try to influence our election. The USA never does that... because they think it's wrong. Just listen to them talking about how wrong it is. The USA would never do that.
"They will say it is because I am white but I just they are sticking to their roots and paying homage to the older Planet of the Apes movies. It's refreshing to have apes over having any sort of race washing. On that note my favorite POTA line ""hey kids, want some aspirin"""
Defranco proving yet a again what a moron he is.
I'm so tired of hearing about Trump and Russia. Anytime you talk about it my brain automatically switches off
Lauren Southern did nothing wrong
"Personally I think this whole Russian narrative is just a fake news story being perpetuated by Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama who are acting like they're presidents-in-exile and refusing to give POTUS free air to govern. This is evidenced by the fact that this narrative has been going for 6 months now and shows no signs of letting up.

Get used to the Russia narrative because these lefty socialist/communists are like a rudderless ship at the moment drifting into rocks. The bigger and more important issue here is that USA foreign policy regarding Russia (yes it's a real country lefties!) has been wedged by the left and basically locked into a state of cold war that could conceivably lead to an actual war with Russia.

And yes that's really where we're at, POTUS can't even normalise relations with them because he'll be accused of being on their side. That's actually bad for both Americans and Russians because the chance of military conflict between the two countries is dangerously high as outlined by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

The two worlds biggest nuclear super powers don't even have a telephone line, because if POTUS tries to put those things in place he will be attacked as being a Russian operative. Even if you are a lefty, you must realise that is a dangerous position not only for USA & Russia but for the World and we can only hope conflict does not start as a result."
"Phil, Antifa is a domestic terrorist organization. They all share the same anarchist ideology and they dress in a specific black outfit and march in columns and are violent. These people should be arrested because domestic terrorism is not acceptable."
"Well, I have no problem with people convicting criminals who break the law.  However, 1st you have to  prosecute everyone equally or the law is nothing other than a group of suggestions.  So we have two choices really.  Either prosecute everyone of which there is evidence of law breaking, or call a general amnesty, rewrite the legal code so it is concise and reasonable, and start from scratch with nobody is above the law.  Being that there are so many obscure and unenforceable laws on the books, such as you are not allowed to identify yourself by an alias online (I think everyone is guilty here,) I would vote for the second one.  And before you ask, yes that is a law, yes it includes email addresses and video games, and yes it is still on the federal books as a felony.  So if you have every had an email address that was not your full birth name (including work and school btw) you are a criminal.  So I would think that everyone would be for a little reworking of the codes before we take everyone to task for a law that even the lawyers can't fully understand."
SMOKING GUN: Hillary's team met with this very same lawyer and they are the ones that put out the russian / trump fake news story  AND the trump russian prositute pissing story. their last meeting was 2 weeks before trump jr met with him.
"Always feel a bit irritated when you talk about abuout people ""Hurting [their] cause"", because honestly, at least they're out there doing something for their cause, which shouldn't just be 'their' cause, but our cause. If I'm not on the streets doing something myself, I think I should have the good sense not to bark at them from the comfortable high horse in my bedroom ya know.
If one isn't an activist that spends their time for the issue, well... I think we should be looking inwards about that.

Protests are power plays, it's peoples' wills playing against eachother, and every player and ideology is a part of that - Their actions aren't arbitrary, they've arrived at their conclusions just as you have - if that conclusion is different, it might be because they have different experience or information to you."
These assholes have to be shutdown. You can't just randomly target someone and call them a Nazi so you can justify violence. These Germans that hit that guy during that fake protest are the real Nazis.
It's majorly sad that deray fails to make the news whenever hell talk about something relevant but when he makes a misstep it gets blown up.
"I know a vile, confused and violent failed revolution will be set out by these groups."
Lauren Southern is hot as fuck
their cause is Jihad. hurting or killing people won't hurt their cause!
"I feel so ashamed of Germany. ""Nazi pig"", that's how we live out Democracy here, by not having it. If you have an opinion that divides from ""Kiss immigrant ass and live with not getting an apartment for you and your three children because all vacant places to live at are reserved for immigrants"", then you're a Nazi. You're not somebody who is concerned for THEIR future because fuck you, this is Germany and there should be more immigrants walking around than Germans.

Half these fucking people can't speak a SINGLE German word and they don't even fucking try to learn it, they speak Spanish, Italian, Turkish, every language that isn't German. Hell, they don't even pay for a busride, they come in expecting that everything is free for some reason, even our women. The real Nazi pig here is the guy who used violence. He's turning Germany into a multi-cultural shithole of ""Nobody understands anything because they don't want to adjust to our culture"".

Before all these immigrants learn to speak German, we learn arabic first and that's very pathetic. It's even more pathetic that the old, brainless scumbags of our country voted for Angela Merkel again without fact checking ANYTHING. They see CDU, they vote it. CDU could promote terrorism and they'd still win."

"white people always get it wrong when speaking about Black people. stay in your own lane. you just sound racist. and this coming from someone who actually hates black lives matter. and no i'm no snowflake, nor get offended easily. you people just always want to whitesplain what some racist person does, as NOT BEING RACIST. when they literally write books about the neo-racism and symbolism. but of course you wouldn't know about that, because you never do research in whom you're talking about / defending."
The only reason that dumbass thought they were equating black guys and apes is because he himself thinks black guys look like ape. What a fucktard.
i rly like your channel mostly because you actually have a brain lol
"President Trump: never investigated for Any Criminal wrong doing by ANY agency. Trump Jr: Broken NO laws whatsoever and at worst does same that every Democratic Politician does when seeking dirt on other politicians . Meets with a lawyer... Who happens to be a Russian. Same lawyer that literally has pictures meeting with other American politicians He also turns over his emails with that lawyer unasked.... Fake News media calls Trump and anybody connected to him that even Drank Russian Vodka someday a ""criminal""... And liberal dumb sheep actually swallowed their brainwashing spe3rms like good little sheeo. The same corporate media that gets caught lying to them almost every day for decades. Including lying Americans into fake wars. 2 years of daily Russian propaganda by the DNC and its fake media: AND still nothing illegal found donevbuvTrump whatsoecer. Liberals are sheep bc EVERYTHING they believe or are told is based on complete lies to obscure reality from them. Once smart people open their eyes, they leave the Democratic Marxist fake liberal Anti-West Party FOREVER"
"Watsky is probably my favourite thing on youtube.

I don't even agree with a lot of his perspectives."
Antifa are Nazis simples.
"So I know the guy was misguided, buuut there's something interesting there I think...
I watched the new Planet of the Apes movies recently, and noted that the figures of the apes were like revolutionaries, where their treatment by people was really smilar to real- world racism and colonialism - it felt like there might be a lesson to learn for people from it. 

Then I remember thinking wait - is it a problem that they're apes haha - the apes in the movie are clearly the more civil and most times more rational group, as opposed to the 'humans' in the movie - for all intents and purposes, the apes in the movie are basically human. I think it's just an unfortunate coincidence in this case.
Anyway, it's interesting that the poster instigated the discussion now, even if the dude who brought it up did so kinda randomly."
"What i read out of the email of Trump Jr is, he was offered official documents that prove Hillary to be a criminal-

And due to that i suppose it most likely did not seem illegal to him-As what he would get might not necessarily be defamatory content.

But we will see in the close future i guess"

Every single time you quote or mention this guy, it's some really out-of-the-earth kind of stupid shit coming out of his uneducated mouth. Please just drop him, stop giving this jerk any more attention. You could present a lemon to this guy and he would call you racist for implying that you want to handfeed him lemons because he's black. He's triggered at everything because he's probably not very happy with his OWN race, otherwise he'd chin up and stop pitying himself and black people over every single thing that could be harmful towards black people."

"I think an important fact to note is that Lauren Southern isn't an Identitarian, she's Conservative. Luke from WeAreChange is a Centrist Libertarian, and Tim Pool is a Centre Left Libertarian (Liberal). The other guy, Max, isn't even friends with the other three. He's just a German independent journalist who recognized Luke from his reporting, and decided to introduce himself, and work with the group of journalists. Lauren and Tim had never met the guy before. Max isn't a Nazi, and didn't deserve to get beat up. None of them are Nazis, and none of them deserve to get beat up, or stalked, or harassed. AntiFa is a terrorist organization, and they literally used their network to commit terrorism against the press."
Puth may have been on YouTube longer but PSY has been an active musician since 1999. They both deserved the top spot and recognition.
"As a not legal expert and really just based on those emails, I don't think solicitation makes sense. He didn't ask for that information so much as it was offered to him. I think it should be illegal to do whatever the specific wording required is that the Trump administration has done while working with Russia, if it's found to be sorta okay, or totally fine nothing illegal that would be very dissapointing. A symptom of the system Trump was supposed to fix/break/idk-eat?"
Funny a German calling someone else a naziü§î
I've been saying that the Planet of the Apes apes represent BLM months before BLM finally noticed....
You hate black people
"I grew up in the same town and went to the same high school as Charlie Puth. He's a huge asshole and everyone here hates him. All the stuff he said about being bullied in high school was false, and his family was poor until he was about 3 which is when they got super rich. He also used to show up at high school parties after he graduated and would basically try to use his YouTube fame to get girls to blow him. He's just not a good person at all. And his music is bland to boot."
"She was asking for trouble. There's a lot of guilt, parano√Øa and anger in Germany around Nazism. She baited that with her stupid shirt. Same tactic as Anita Sarkeesian."
"The only reason that those black guys got offended is because they subconsciously see themselves as apes, and they project their personal issues onto other people. It's the same reason why they seemingly find ""racism everywhere"". Not being racism IS actually everywhere (Obviously it's not) but because they're projecting their own racism through their ideological lens, and seeing it everywhere. Racists see racism where there isn't any. Seeing racism everywhere means that person has an obsession with race, and do you know what people are obsessed with race? That's right: racists."

Who the fuck has a fantastic Tuesday?
"Any member of the Trump family could fart outside and they'd be attacked for polluting the air. This email dump proves nothing. Still waiting for Hillary to dump her emails, oh wait, she smashed and bleached the servers upon investigation"
"So the Russian attorney's facebook was found and it turns out she has several anti-trump pictures and a profile picture dating back 2014, so it seems like a valid profile. Biggest speculation is she's a Democrat plant.

This is really getting out of hand."
"Also, the original novel was not targeted at black peoples, but Japanese. 

The author was a POW of the Japanese in WWII"
Disgusting how some left wing media is downplaying the violent acts of terrorists like antifa at the G20 protest.
"Identiwhatnow? I thought I was pretty aware of the whole right wing resurgence thing, but I've literally never heard of this movement. An explanation would have been nice Phil."
"This Trumb shit is pure garbage, Ukraine, Germany and Saudi Arabia all sponsored the Clinton campaign so what's the deal with Russia being pro Trump? Don't you Americans know that these so called ""elections"" are one big show anyway?"
"How do you feel about superheros then,they kill in order to help others."
"G20? Nah I'm with G1 am I right wrestling fans? xD
Seriously tho, peaceful protests turned riots seems to be happening more and more frequently, which is super scary for the future imo."
Since when do I click your links and they take me off your video? THA FUCK?
No secret link :(
"Wait, if it's illegal to receive donations from foreign nationals, why was Hillary Clinton allowed to accept several million dollars directly from the Saudi and Qatar governments during the presidential campaign? If you've set up a precedent where laws aren't enforced and don't mean anything, it's kinda hard to go after people you claim have violated said law."
=]
antifa must be labeled as a terrorist group against western civilization
Phil WHERES THE SECRET LINK
Rename the channel : NOTHING BURGER NEWS
Castille's shooting was justified
"Yes, violence solves nothing, please ignore the switchblade."
"'unjustified shooting of philando Castile'. That's your opinion and I respect that. But I strongly disagree with you. He was asked not to reach for his gun, yet he ignored the officer and continued to reach for it. It was either him or the officer. Jury then found the officer innocent.

And then what really pissess me off. Is that his girlfriend whips out her phone and starts streaming to Facebook and narrating. I'm sorry but that just shows how little you actually care about your boyfriend. If my boyfriend has been shot, the last thing I'd think of would be filming. I would be in histerics and trying to help him, applying pressure etc... I know that isn't related to Phil's point but I just wanted to get if off my chest."
"hmmm im starting to think he might need a racist friend so that when his about to be offended he can run it by some one that is out side of his bubble, ""hey man does this monkey looks like me?"" ""i dont know which one all monkeys look the same to me"" ""you cant just lump in gorillas with orangutans thats just wrong, get woke"" lol"
Hitler tried! Now you all burn in the fire of tolerance!
"Phil why did you have to show a picture of the devil at 9:10.... for a second it scared me so much that I thought I needed a safe space, until I realized I am a grown ass man and I can view something so horrible and still love through my day normally."
What does identiterian mean? I haven't heard about before now
Antifa are brutal and violent Phil....surprised at how you think this hurts their image when everything they do is violent.
"""we couldn't figure it out"" funny"
"Worst part is that they also exist in my country Denmark lol. Googled them..and sure fucking enough, at least its only in √Örhus and I guess Copenhagen."
You almost had a like from me until you made Trump Jr's nothing burger and Hillary's crimes equal. You're really starting to get underneath my skin kiddo.
5:22 Kimmy Kimmel Live?Fake news!
The G20 protester's riots and violence can't hurt their cause if the media isn't reporting it. Funny.
I like you you get new sub :)
you should talk about Obama stealing almost a billion from Freddie Mac illegally to support  affordable health care
"Deray is wrong in his reaction.  I've watched the trailers that the monkey with the vest is in and the monkey is an older, less hardy monkey that probably can't withstand the cold as well as his fellow species.  It wasn't a subtle message.  It was a monkey trying to stay warm in freezing weather."
It's funny how Donald Trump Jr's name is also the perfect description of him.
What about the secret-link? üòØ
"Its a very wide definition to give judges the flexability to decide whether something is ""of value"". Basically its up to their discression and its very common."
"""preach tolerance with fists"" wow, that should be a catchphrase of our generation"
"In the movie, the apes speak English...just like African Americans.  Can you really dismiss that as mere coincidence??"
Trump Jr. colluding with Russians to dig up dirt on Hillary who colluded with Russians. Thats just the tip of the iceberg. The US government is an inception of corruptions inside corruptions inside corruptions. That is why the FBI will never finish their investigation.
<3
"What a joke, Philip: Actual terrorists = Protesters over extending themselves and hurting their argument. 

Go fuck yourself. Twat."
i dont know why people are always attacking hollywood for racism hollywoods literally made up of liberals
Secret link of the day?
"If they smack you in the face like that calling you a nazi punch back, antifas are bullies and bullies are total pussies when someone stands up to them."
We need Hitler to come back to liberate Europe. Sieg Heil

"So glad for Charlie Puss



I know someone understands"
#ShutupTariq
"They didn't have a problem with the last Planet of the Apes film. Is that just because no apes in that movie were wearing blue vests or what?
Just goes to show that if there is a possibility for something to become a racial issue these days someone will try to create tension over it no matter how loose or vague the ""reference"" is. It's really sad how people actively look for things to be offended over these days. Apes and monkeys are a thing, people. This is not new."
"Love the way you say ""Puth""."
"In my opinion Trump jr. definitely lied claiming no meeting with russian representatives was set up. If there would be any legal consequences of this lie, that's a whole different story.

On the Antifa riots in Hamburg during the G20 summit, I'm ashamed of these protesters. Admittedly the Antifa promotes a violent approach against right-wing political representatives as well as representatives of national authority (i.e. police), but that doesn't give them any right to ransack two stores and torch cars. That's just burglary, theft and criminal property damage. Fighting against cops is a different thing, although illegal as well. And stalking ""identitarian"" protesters only to attack and insult them is just the cherry on top of this big pile of bullshit.

Violence isn't the answer to any problem. It just makes the problems worse."
"This is not the ""peaceful majority is having their arguments hurt by a radical minority"" thing going on there. Nearly all of those protesters are violent crooks who have already caused millions of euros in property damage. And all that money is going to be taken from the peaceful german taxpayer because those antifa fucks are all jobeless commies who want to destroy but not create."
"@ 9:02 XD HAHA! 
Trump Jr doesn't realize that it's still illegal."
one of these days i will leave a comment above and no one will know how or why but they will know that no one tells me where to leave my comments
Two wrongs don't make a right sure but it's only wrong for either of them because one of them has the name Trump. -_-
I would like to know if you are going to be covering the alex Mauer  DMCA strike spree. right now it is being covered by a small youtube known as sidalpha but I would like to hear about it from you
"Working in business/sales, I've always had to sign an agreement to not accept bribes, payments, gifts or any other thing ""of value"". This has always meant monetary value, not informational value. As far as the solicitation charge, Don Jr did not solicit information; it was offered to him. He did not say, ""Billy Bob, go find me a Russian government attorney and see if they have information about Hillary."" Obviously the narrative of ""nothing came of it"" is true, as nothing was ever released or disclosed. Don Jr got scammed. Either way, he is not a part of Trump's administration or the transition team. Donald Trump has plausible deniability. Still no dealings/collusion with the Russian  government. Nice try though."
"As for the ethics around the US-Russia situation. Let's say Russia did hack the DNC and clintons emails, revealing widespread corruption and gave those emails to the Trump team, and he used that information to win the election.. wouldn't that really mean Russia did America a favour? It secured cast iron evidence that Clinton is a duplicitous bitch who would have been terrible not only for America but for the entire world."
"Look on the one hand, yeah I can see why people might take offense to the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise, seeing the apes as allegories for people of color. Hell there's potential to use the apes as a metaphor/commentary on ""race"" relations. It's been done before.....................................Then again this is a Hollywood summer blockbuster and I have doubts they'd try and delve into¬†this complex social issue. And BTW when I say ""race"", I mean, ultimately, there's only one race that matters: the human race. We're all, or we should be, equal based on the color of our skin or our ethnicity. Using ""race"" to divide rather than differentiate (believe me there's a difference) is BS."
"BLM literally going around calling black people apes. 

Thats fucking funny."
"There are legal definitions, they are different from dictionary definitions, because dictionary definitions follow colloquial definitions and evolve with language and you don't want your laws changing just cause language evolves. 

He lied, he didn't do anything illegal, its still worthy of criticism and if you're a Hillary supporter using this to further justify hating Trump you're a hypocrite."
"NO SECRET LINK! riot!
as always, thanks for the very informative video"
"Lauren Southern is not a Nazi 
Antifa are a pack of fucking knuckle dragging idiots..... seriously ............ they take Dumb and Dumber to a whole new level.
Also just for those Antifa dickheads reading this ........ hot tip ....dont attack Reporters ..... they have a platform to destroy you from .......... especially when YOU are in the wrong. they go back to work and then your stupiddity get printed or played all over the place like hmmm I dont know ......... The Phillip DeFranco show  >.>  
Just a tip......."
"If enough people start doing it, it will become the norm. It won't hurt their argument anymore. The world is doing a looptiloop, Phil"
"look, im liberal, i support blm as a movement, i do not support some of their actions. That deray guy is kindave an idiot based on this. Thats just critical thinking, hes dumbüòÇ"
people find rasism everywhere nowadays. It has become ridiculous...
"This is why I seek you out in times of propaganda.  While I'm sure you have a personal agenda, you are willing to gaze into the grey area more than most commentators. 

Things are never black and white."
"""I don't think it means what you think it means"" üòÇ"
"What happened with the DNC and Hillary is a separate issue, and needs to be investigate as such. The Russian issue is not gone or less because of it."
"Yes it would be wrong in a lot of different ways, but I really wish Phill would stop covering stories about black people. His fans are way to stupid to understand the concept of individuality and it just hurts my heart hearing what people think of us. As if it isn't bad enough white people are constantly scared of me because I'm a tall black guy.

One black guy says or does something dumb and then apparently all black people are dumb. They see black people as this odd new species then decide to judge the whole race based on the actions of a few people. 

Like stop fucking asking me for weed... I've never even smoked before in my life."
"i've yet to see that 2billion plus viewed video stil trying to bring myself up to speed on the Fast n Furious films. heh, speed."
Funny how people are getting but hurt over planet of the apes movie.Feel like its kinda ironic that blm assume that an ape represents black people.
"Antifa is a domestic terrorist group. They act more like nazis than their political opposition.

And on the whole BLM retardation - if you think an ape Hollywood modeled after an actual ape is a reference to you, I think this says more about you than it says about the movie director."
"Its not okay to hurt people but to pretend that Lauren Southern and Rebel Media don't purposefully go to these events to rile people up and get footage to promote their own agenda is silly. Fuck antifa, they're a bunch of anarchist idiots, and Rebel Media are also antagonistic retards."
"Christ on a fucking bike, there's a lot of angry people commenting on this. I only scrolled down to see if anyone had asked/explained what an ""identitarian"" is (not a term I've come across before). Is there no middle ground any more?"
"Hey, we got something that shows that Hillary is corrupt and has dealings with Russia, wanna see? Sure, says Trump Jr. The take away? TRUMP IS IN BED WITH RUSSIA AND THATS ALL THAT MATTERS!!! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!"
"from where im sitting as reported by keith olbermann yesterday it was an hr or so after the meeting that the now cheeto and chief first tweeted the  number of emails that were hacked 33,000 so im doubting that no info was passed at said meeting. . just saying !!!"
"Twitter needs to die, and people need to quit quoting it."
The great thing about dumb criminals is that they usually dig their own graves. #FuckTrump
If we were fascists we would be preaching tolerance with bullets you morons. Do they not get what fascism is?
Way to make g20 protest about americans -.- why not cover the actual news!
"Sometimes I feel like stories like this that only cover the negative aspects of the protests are adding fuel to the fire of discrediting those who are doing good. I'm not saying you shouldn't talk about the bad parts at all, but maybe give the good bits some more air time. It may not be ""entertaining"" but if you want those who are doing good to outshine the bad, give them more coverage."
Wait... Where is the secret link of the day?
"I'm wondering, has our government always been as corrupt as it is in House of Cards? Or has this just started recently? (You know, with all of this back channeling and secret negotiations)"
We're smarter than everybody
good on you for covering the protest and the violent nature of what went down.
the end is near
If literally one says nothing people would react equally as if one says something regardless of his political perspective.
"if people brought racial issues in light aside from movies, i think people would take it seriously. when people of color complain about issues in hollywood (unfortunately, that's where a lot of people verified on twitter bring it), i think it actually makes them look silly. real life is real and movies are movies. focus on the real issues and don't let hollywood/movies control your feelings and life. most people don't relate to hollywood movies. so why not try to voice your OWN thoughts and feelings without scripted movies giving you a guideline on how to feel."
These 'Antifascists' are the kind of people who would round up jews in 1940's europe. Nowadays it just happens that the trend is rounding up supposed 'nazis'
"your jump cuts are making me crazy, you're not leaving enough time for us to analyse the information and it makes your voice monotone."
Phil there are no arguments for sacks of shit spouting lies 24/7.
"Finding bad things to say about Trump is not the same as interfering with the election and lying about it.

Donald Jr. knew full well what he was doing. Your person-who-sounds-like-a-coke dealer-is-actually-trying-to-sell-chocolate analogy makes no sense."
What's your favourite meme?
Ridiculous. Youtubers being beat up and called Nazis. So infuriating.
I thought g20 was nations talking and getting along?
Antifa do not have a just motive. They are all scum
"As a resident of Hamburg I can just say that this weekend has been hell. Large parts of the city haven been vandalized, friends and coworkers had their cars burned down and windows smashes. The people that took the demonstrations too far did so without any cause. I tried to start a conversation with some of them to see if there might actually be some reasoning behind it that I may have missed but all they had to offer were vague arguments along the lines of ""if we don't do this Putin and Trump will think what they're doing is okay"". When I asked them if they really thought that our city's condition was of any concern to foreign political leaders, they wouldn't answer. We're all angry and we have a right to be but I fail to see how putting things on fire will help the cause."
"Don Jr would be an attractive man if it wasn't for that perpetually smug little mouth of his, I guess Donald only has nice female genes in his family"
We're all decendend from apes so I don't see the problem. Our skin colour is dependend on where our ancestors came from. White skin for little sun and the darker skin gets the more sun. I don't get why apes are the problem here. If at all we should all be offended.
So um... wheres the secret link?...
"I find Antifa's actions in Germany one of the ironic protest/riots they've performed to date. As far as I know, their entire movement is based around being anti-fascist and using more direct methods such as violence and intimidation to attempt to silence opponents. That alone is pretty extreme but sometimes understandable with Germany's history with the Nazi movement. 

But the major problem is whom they consider a Nazi or Fascist to begin, by following the ideology of Anarcho-Communism (represented by the red and black flags) merely having the belief that society should operate with a free market is more than enough to enrage a lot of its members. I consider the commonly coined line ""Liberals get the bullet too!"" pretty definitive evidence that they're far more dangerous than what the mainstream media is making out to be.

But what I find ironic is the means they're using to achieve their goal. Shutting down discussion, fighting against every other political group and bringing down the current system to replace it with something more authoritarian is the complete opposite of what an anti-fascist should be doing."
"If you think apes look like you, does that mean you look like apes?"
"Can we have a ""preach tolerance with your fists"" shirt please?"
"If you can‚Äôt convince a fascist, introduce their teeth to the pavement."
"The G20 protests were a disgrace, I mean, burning small old cars and smashing the windows of independent local shops? Yeah, take that fucking capitalists! Antifa are mostly Hooligans looking for an excuse to fuck shit up and they hurt the reputation of anyone who's leaning to the left in the process."
"The notion, that an ape wearing a blue puffy vest in the newest Planet of the Apes is sending a racist message, is just straight out ridiculous. Should I be offended that a black hooded person is drinking the blood of a WHITE unicorn during a scene in Harry Potter and the Philosopher Stone? Is it sending a message that black people are sucking the life out of us 'innocent' white people? Please. Everyone can twist and turn whatever they see into how they want to see it, if they take it out of context. Context always matters."
"The Donald Jr story is going nowhere,  he is the president's son, not only that but Trump's son he can kill a baby by stomping on its head and he wouldn't even see court"
We'll I have never heard of Deray but it looks like he is a fucking moron with a IQ so low he is jealous of Forrest Gump.
"I agree with you Phil, but let's be clear. Lauren Southern is not a Nazi."
Are you kidding me? Hollywood is more liberal than anything else.
Fucking hate liberals. Just lying and being ignorant as fuck.
With the #BlackLivesMatter situation. It doesn't surprise me that this is a thing. Usually #BlackLivesMatter is grasping at straws that don't exist
if Justin Bieber had a song in 1st u wouldnt say an actual youtuber but he actually was too like charlie puth
"What's crazy to me is that people are trying to get Trump impeached, as if they don't realize they'll have Mike fucking Pence as their president. Pence is great as an assassination deterrent, and a brilliant pick by Trump because of that, but I don't want to live through a Pence presidency. It is neat to see spirit of the law and letter of the law enter the debate, but we really need to decide on ONE of those things to govern all of our laws, and I personally think spirit of the law would be best. Even if it means that the progeny of The Meme Himself, God Emperor Trump would probably go to prison."
"I know your not a war torn vet or anything, but the more you preach none violence in every situation, the more you just come off as sissified. Would hurt someone trying to carry your child off to an internment camp? If a gun is loaded, and you are aiming at someone dragging your wife/mother  away, do you shoot? They don't give a fuck about your words.
 ""hey put my wife down!""- non violent person
""shut up bitch"" -scary person"
why no secret link of the day?
I seem to remember in history about a German socialist using violence went bad. Need to look at the definition of Nazi again.
"Hey atleast Trump Jr, have the balls/or stupidity to ""leak"" this sensitive information on the interweb before the MSM could get their filthy fingers on it"
there was no secret link and that made me sad. :(
"So, two men supporters of the Black Lives Matter got offended by an ape in a movie. An APE? As in the common mammal on Earth? I get that centuries ago they [African Americans]  were seen as apes but come on. This 2017. No one sees African Americans as apes. Ffs..."
No. The shooting of Philando Castile was not unjust.
"Phil the more you preach anti violence the more I think you are living in your own fantasy. This particular situation didn't call for violence. And nowhere near all situations need a violent reaction, but what about shit like Flint, MI. You even ignore the problem. People have been dealing with the bullshit that comes with ""talking it out"" for over 3 years. (while they have severe lead issues the entire time)

 Talking to a wall does nothing but create echos. Once in a blue-moon we need a Malcolm X, and we need to drop ""the meek shall inherit the Earth"" bullshit. Words don't work on the corrupt.

There are 100 things people should be dead in the street fighting for, but nothing will change b/c the rulers of society don't want it to."
they wont even put you on my home menu anymore wtf
Planet of the apes doesn't have anything racial in it people need to get over it sit down and just enjoy a movie series.
"The comments are like ""Oh Antifa became so shitty bla bla"". NO. They didn't ""become shitty"". They have always been like this. German Antifa is not like your cute little triggered Antifa dude from 'murica. German Antifa is a lot more violent and dangerous than Antifa in any other place of the world. These people are just insane."
German antifa members were calling a polish reporter a nazi in the protests. These people have no sense of irony
They got a problem with what Donald Trump Jr. did but still the media buries the story on the Clinton Foundation. Okay then...
Like Phil but it's disappointing that he thinks there is any merit whatsoever to this constant Russia garbage.
"The only way Trump his family or anyone of his ""group"" will ever be held accountable for any shit they do is if they kill someone, no one seems to care about the rest of the shit."
Lets play spot the difference kids.    Antifa - Fascists     SWJ's - Crybabys      BLM - Ignorant morons    Feminists - Female dogs  .    Did you spot the difference kids??         No me neither
"I miss the ""Hey! Das not cool"" segment"

"Psy video plays on a loop in this korean restaurant i used to cook at.
every song on that playlist made you feel amp'd to eat."
Talking to Russians is illegal? I guess I can't play csgo anymore
"I am a HUGE Planet of the Apes fan and when I seen the movie poster I actually commented to my husband ""oh look that's like an update on the original,"" referring to the vest. Why does everyone have a problem with everything these days. We've got real world problems going on right now, keep focus on those.
And with the protest situations, they are making it to where ppl are afraid to go out and protest. I have a son and have actually taken him to a cpl ""protest"" for causes I believe in. I wanted him to know from a young age that he has a voice and to use it. But we are at a place now where it would just be irresponsible and dangerous to do that now- which is sad and unproductive IMO. It makes me far less likely to participate in certain things bc I'm fearful. Not just for myself but others. I'm not someone who could stand on the sidelines as another person (whether I share their views or not) be physically attacked. It also makes my husband uncomfortable for me to participate in certain things on my own, bc he is concerned for my safety. Ppl looting and setting things on fire etc, it's scary."
CNN MUST TEMPTING TO COMMIT SUICIDE RIGHT AFTER THE EMAIL.  HILLARY IS A CROOKED ?  NO FKIGN WAY LOL
"Yes,point taken, but Laura Southern is a retard! I think she's on some death wish or something! Ever since the boat refugee incident, she seems to be getting further and further into many more dangerous situations in what she calls ""reporting"", but she does very little actual reporting. I think she's just a psycho looking for praise and notoriety. She will end up dead pretty soon if she keeps going down this road!"
"In planet of the apes u see a white guy getting killed by an ape wow I'm offended. Is this a message to the public that we should kill all white people WOW movies has gone 2 far.>:(
This is basically everyone in 2017 shut the fuck up and just realize that it's a got damn movie."
"BLM is a sick joke, nit picking dicks, Planet of the apes is one of my favorite franchises and hearing them trying to shit on it rustles my jimmies."
How have I never heard 'Wiz Khalifa - See You Again ft. Charlie Puth' before?????
"I know Phil tries to remain unbiased but it really pisses me off when he doesn't denounce Antifa and BLM as hate groups because those are exactly what they are. Antifa solves all their problems through riots and violence, targeting people who don't have their same socialist or even anarchist viewpoint. BLM is used by blacks to push the agenda that white people/cops should always be responsible if any black man is killed. They also have a huge anti-white basis as some places ban white people from being in BLM. They try to blame white people for blacks being killed when black on black crime is  significantly higher percentage wise than white on black crime."
"Lauren made a couple videos where she ... lets say... not talk in favor about antifa and she kind of walked along a right wing side during a US Protest. Now if she wouldnt have worn that shirt, nobody would have given a shit probably, or even start tracking her. But she acted naive and if there is one thing you should not be naive about in germany, its left wing radicals and right wing radicals. They are NOT the same as they are anywhere else in the world, they are much more organized, violent and financially supported."
"black lives still matter though......
quit giving the crazy ones too much spot light please!"
"i like what you do here on the channel, but it seems like all you do these days is cover news about people over reaching and debunking other news. Maybe want to change focus more onto international news like 1MDB and ESports (Dota tournament) and stuff like that abit more?"
"Hold the goddamn phone, we have a problem with Trump campaign getting any assistance from a foreign government yet it's alright when Hilary's campaign got contributions from Russians, and Iraqi governments through the Chelsey Clinton foundation.  Could we just not with the double standards I mean I am not saying Trump should get a pass but shouldn't we deal with the issue as a whole instead of just one person. As I recall almost every campaign for the last ever has had some kind of foreign government supporting a campaign. As I recall Bill Clinton's campaign had donations from China. So where was the legal experts when that happened."
"BLM IS FULL OF BS.  THEY ALWAYS BITCH ABOUT SOMETHING.  THEY ONLY BITCH WHEN IT BENEFIT THEM.  WHEN THEIR KIND DOING SOMETHING STUPID, NO WHERE BLM IS FOUND.  ALL THEY ACT LIKE BLACK WERE THE ONLY ONE WERE SLAVE."
"Considering how Gamergate was supposed to be a bunch of violent right wing terrorists, it's an interesting to compare how easily we find footage of extreme left-wing groups committing violence compared to the scarcity of similar evidence for Gamergate's supposed violence. This is a recurring theme.

The extreme left is right now a far bigger threat than any other domestic movement. It's not that the extreme right is any better, but there is a societal aversion to calling out this bullshit that shields the left while demonising the right. I guarantee you The Guardian's minimised coverage of the G20 riots would be prominent and persistent front page coverage were these extreme right wing groups causing the problems."
bunch if Shit I don't give a fuck about. just like usual.
Lol Deray just over extended sooo much... he punched himself in the face.
"I mean you are talking about antifa after all, I have never seen more retarded and violent people."
I mean atleast he released his emails unlike a certain somewoman we know.
My mom was born in Hamburg ... she said they always try to keep the city so clean.  It is really sad.  I don't understand or will NEVER understand why people think they can further their cause with violence and destruction.  It disgusts me!
"*Justified shooting of Philando Castille. The man was repeatedly told not to reach, he was fitting a profile of a violent armed criminal which is why he was pulled over. He was told repeatedly not to reach, he did anyway."
"You read the Trump Jr Emails in the wrong order Phil. What you said was the end was the beginning of the chain and vice versa. Trump Jr himself just tweeted them out of Chronological order. Notice the dates on each email and the more coherent conversation when read ""backwards""."
"Fuck Antifa
Bash the antifa"
"I went to see War of the Planet of the Apes last night, and yes: there's racial connotations. Because it's basically about ethnic cleansing. There is a moment in the MUST SEE MOVIE (really, truly, one of the best things I've seen in years) where enslaved apes raise their fist above their heads that reminded me of every movie about slavery ever. So is this movie about race? Amongst other things, definitely. But that's a really good thing, because these three prequels make for one of the best movies about war and tribalism EVER. It just shows you that taking a Funko-pop to critique a work of art (even if it's pop culture) is dumb. Dumb. Dumb."
Antifa calls people Nazi's while acting like Gestapo
"A friend and I were watching the All-Star Game earlier and saw the commercial for the POTA movie and as soon as I saw Woody Harrelson as the White Skinhead leader of the Humans I¬†figured it was going to be¬†another SJW flick which really sucks as SOMEONE would find SOMETHING offensive. I grew up on the original series and had an enormous..uh..infatuation with Linda Harrison. Anyway as I was thinking about this I remembered I saw a ""Making of"" type of film about the original movie. One of the people involved told of lunchtime on the set and it seems there were several tables for the cast and extras yet when lunchtime hit this person noticed that all the ""Chimps"" were at one table and all the ""Gorillas"" were at another and so forth, there were no signs that said ""Orangutans here"" or anything like that. Wonder what SJW Hollywood would make of that....Just sayin' ya beautiful bastard!"
So Stranger Things is coming out on my birthday :)
"So, in short. One way or another we would have a criminal in office. 

As someone who doesn't live in America, I can't but point and laugh at you guys. Your political system is fucked up"
That ape wearing the vest looks hairless like in the trailers
"""I am offended over a balding ape in a poster! With a blue vest!""

We really need to start classifying ANTIFA as a terrorist group. The only thing they are doing is classifying everyone who is not with them as enemies and then using violence against these people to instill fear and forcing people to join them if they want to be safe. Those are terrorist tactics 101. How long before people start taking it too far and people get killed?
"Let us be real. Sometimes violence is the only answer when cries are ignored and protests are squashed. 

In the words of master rapper, Ceschi:

I've got friends who would rather end society
Because there's no way of fixing these flaws
And that's starting to make far more sense to me now
Cause we're lazy and used to what's wrong

It's been embedded inside us since our first breaths
We're destroying the world where we live
But I'm sitting here watching a T.V. in bed
Wondering why I lack happiness

----
All of us are just frightened roosters in a ring
Ready to pounce and fight anything
Though none of us will ever know what freedom is
We have certainly felt lack of it

Proverbs and clich√©s remind me that
I should learn to appreciate what I can get
But they're forcing us to live within our own shit 
And I wasn't born to be a pig!

Oh disappointing mouth
Hold your tongue
So the cops don't come and beat the words from you
Sing in tune now!"
Antifa can't hurt their cause by using violence when their cause is to use violence...

"Even if Hollywood did the ape thing on purpose, why's everyone surprised...? Everyone of these social justice warrior groups should know that they're considered useful idiots by the elites who fund their little bullshit riots and groups. They should know by now that Hollywood thinks that they're all jokes and the only ones who get the credit of their ""movements"" are the celebrities who makes speeches about them at award shows and politicians taking credit for ""getting the word out"". All you people are pathetic jokes."
The fact that they found and associated this one man with a random ape wearing clothing says something...
I'M OFFENDED!
Why are liberals so dumb
I'm not happy to see Charlie Puth passed PSY because the song is shittier
Charlie pith also bastardized Marvin Gaye's what's going on
"So how come Hillary skated away committing a crime, a very serious one, while holding a very serious position in government, with loads of evidence proving so.... and Trump's shit has had ZERO evidence and the dickhead's keep coming up with bullshit to try to make up a story. Enough is enough people. Hillary sold off Uranium to Russia, the past decade has been peppered with Islamic Terrorism all around the world and you fuckwits continue to push the narrative that Trump and Putin have been colluding and they are the ""bad guys"". Wow. A generation of people that get ALL their info from headlines and nothing more. It's a real shame the Obama presidency was never held to such scrutiny, perhaps Benghazi wouldn't have happened because everyone would have been doing their job correctly as opposed to making appearances on Ellen and taking campaign contributions from foreign governments in expectations of political favors down the line... Thank God we weren't auctioned off as Hillary or Bernie had planned for the halfwitted generation of supporters."
"antifa are just brainwashed useful idoits of the elites , antifa are a tool to cause social  unrest , then the Crack down by cops and military,  then no  rights because  of       Marshall law ! then the start of civil war,  then the streets run red with blood!  WE FUCKING  LOSE EVERYTHING!!!!!!"
"So, these ppl (supports of these emails, regardless of their ""party"") have no common sense? No, critical thinking skills. Have they lost their minds? I can't believe they are willingly eating bullshit, our American FBI, ours not theirs ours! has flat out said, Russia is hacking the United States trying to influence OUR American Election- they are trying to ""influence"" (corrupt) our Government any way they can through any means possible, official or unofficial,  and here is this idiot clear as day meeting with Russians and they are like oh it's okay, HELLO! You morons, us American-They are Russian government (controlled by a fucken dictator) what do you think they fucken want! I just can't believe they are willing to risk our America, to keep this con artist president can't the Republican Party grow balls and find another better- No, qualified president are they saying he's their ideal?"
"If they made all the apes more.. well... ""caucasian"" looking, would that have come off any less racist? (Not to say that the apes in the clips look like people of colour - they look like common coloured apes. Fffff.) Should they have been rainbow apes?"

The most watched video on youtube is of a rapper who is a known pot head!!  Whether your against or for Pot..The number 1 youtube video of every country and in history is basically a modern day Snoop Dog???  Is this what you want America??

"There was this one comment on Laurens video, i copy pasted it, just food for thought; ""Reality is, violence determines the winner. Always has, always will.

"I am still looking into it, but there is evidence that the Russian lawyer DT jr met with might be an Obama/DNC plant because there are pictures of her hanging out with the Obama appointed ambassador to Russia. This is pictures I have seen from a pro-Trump biased source so I am taking that with a grain of salt, however, pictures are pictures and there are few unbiased sources out there."

Also, what a shame we have MSM, because if all we had were ""new media"" like Phil then we'd totally know about this, wouldn't we? Because the ""new media"" are totally good at doing all the actual footwork, aren't they? They totally don't leech off MSM while at the same time railing against them, do they?"

Wow Phil sure does spend a lot of time defending Nazis doesn't he?
"As hilarry deletes 30,000 emails, and wants to allows abortion. But, yet theres no big deal with that right? Yea shows how liberals are growing in size. Thats how we are going to be as dumb as rocks."
"One other thing, I am at a point where I'm ashamed to be a human. There's so much violence and strife over such simple, stupid things. I'd love to be considered one of the apes on The Planet Of The Apes. Apes don't make such a big deal about colors, or much else. They also don't only come together after tragedy strikes. It's only after tragedy that colors and religious views don't matter. Why is that? That's quite shameful and kind of irritating. You're all one race, you're all humans, why do you allow such petty things to lead to violence? Do you not understand that violence only destroys not only what you're striking out against, but it destroys anything being done. All lives are interrupted when violence happens. You're not helping anybody or anything, you're only disrupting people's lives and hurting yourselves. It's disgusting. You don't see animals in nature arguing over things that are so petty. They're coexisting together doing what they can to survive. If you're going to argue my point by saying that animals don't have as big of a working brain as a human, you look at yourself and ask yourself this: Are we really worthy of having such a wonderful gift as powerful as our intelligence if we're only going to use it to spread strife, hatred, and violence at such a rapid rate over such petty things? I'm not a Trump supporter, but I don't support Hillary either. They're both horrible, human beings who shouldn't have any power over anything, but are we really going to dwell on the whole Russia thing? What do you seek to gain out of that? He already won, and it's done and over with, there's nothing that can be done about it, regardless of Russian interference, right? I mean, we have the option of impeachment, but is it really worth it? His campaign promises were fairly far out there, and he's really the only ""politician"" that's actually a human and not a robot built for having power, and he's actually living up to his promises so far. He's doing as he said he would do, and people are getting angry about it? But, then if he doesn't do as he said he would do, people still get angry about it? I mean, give the guy a break. He's only human. He's just as human as you or me, despite the news trying to depict him as the antichrist. I'm not saying that out of bias at all, I know for a fact that if Hillary were president, she'd be getting crucified by the right wing media too. There's no such thing as no bias. It's what kind of bias that matters. Humans have bias built into them from the way they were raised, it's not possible for somebody to be unbiased, it's simply the type of bias. And that's why I like you, Phil! You have all the bias in an unbiased manner! You're biased towards the people and I both like and respect that! That's why I continue to watch you, strictly due to the type of bias that you have. You're not biased towards a specific group or organization, but to the people who watch your show. I have more respect for you than I do my own father! Will you adopt me? Kidding! Unless you're looking to add to the Defranco family. Kidding. Or am I?"
People like to take things so far now a days and make things so personal. I wish people could just be excited for a movie without having to rip it to shreds or analyze it for something to take offense about.

"the whole argument that ""black people have been described as apes so an ape wearing a blue vest is racist"" is basically the same as ""i am white so all cracker commercials offend me"" because at one point in time white people were called crackers. It is asinine, Grow Up."
"I want to assume it's Just the defranco audience and not the American populous at large that hold such contempt and disregard for human lives in general (let's forget BLM as  movement for a second). Just fcuking yesterday a story about a police officer shooting a DOG drew out the same sentiment about disproportionate force as POC have been trying to express about the murder of actual humans for years now. Today someone thought a vest was racist and the comment is full of blacks deserve to get shot, BLM are the same as the KKk and Nazis??! I can't with you people."
Only in the USA will black people be stupid enough to be offended by a movie about apes when real issues exist. Explain how apes are insulting to black people?
"It's strange how an individual's irrational actions can apparently hurt an entire cause... stranger how people only apply it in certain situations (with certain people).  

You lash out irrationally at a person who bullied you in the past?  Well now everything positive you said about anti-bullying is no longer valid.  

You're a supporter of an anti-fascist movement?  Well you're now a part of a great hypocrisy 'cause a stranger in a different city you've never been in was stupid and threw a Molotov Cocktail at a car.  

Oh, but we shouldn't generalize.  The leader of a party you're associated with spews hate unabashedly and stomps on civil liberties?  Well, let's not be hasty and paint everyone in that party under the same brush now, 'cause that's judgmental.   

A great public figure spews hate, incites violence, and runs on a platform that aims to curb the rights of a very specific group of people?  Well you can't protest 'em now, you hear?  'Cause that's wrong.  You gotta hear 'em out.  Take the higher road.  In fact, vote for 'em when they run!  That'll show 'em that you can see past the bull.  

Yada yada yada."
"What these fucking imbeciles are actually doing is provoking more racism against black people by acting like cretins. 

Another good example, many years ago by now... was some guy took issue with the information graphic signs on buses using white stickmen rather than mixed color stickmen, or black stickmen. Because it reminded him of the days when black people had to stand on buses. 

Never mind that there were signs showing these ""white stickmen""  standing, sitting, giving way, etc. Never mind that the industry standard is to issue such signs with green backgrounds, and white contrasts better than black does. Never mind all that, must be racist!

These idiots make black people look bad. If I didn't happen to have been exposed to people of all sorts of backgrounds and got to know them, and all I saw is how these idiots conduct themselves in social media, I'd be about as racist as your Confederate flag flying redneck by now. 

And of course the mainstream media almost invariably defends these idiots."
"I kinda feel bad for PhilipDeFranco because whichever side does the most stupid things, Philip being sensible opposes the stupidity. Then people call him rightist/leftist for being opposed to insert sided mistake"
"All I can say is if Trump Jr is guilty, then so is Hillary. So if people are going to be held accountable for their actions both parties should be held accountable. So what Hillary wasn't elected, she still broke the same law as he did (allegedly for both people because innocent until proven guilty) so if jail time goes for Jr, Hillary should be with him too."

"I dont understand why if you claim to be anti Fascist (which in its simplest sense most of us should be, not the antifa version however) yet use the exact same tactics that Italian Blackshirts and German SA used to intimidate their opponents and using crowds to attack people they disagree with, it just doesnt make sense. Then theres the issue that they hurt the image of the peacful protesters there and do nothing to legitimise their cause, only damage it."
"Well, this is just shameful. Just a comeplete disaster. Pitful disastser. People cant except whats right... its ridiculous, this is what liberals do. They cry about stuff, when they dont get what they want. Obviously they have no worth and shouldnt be alive. Stupid counterproductive bogus trifling matter.

"""We must teach them our anti-fascist ways, by actual fascism!"""
"A few things I don't get about you humans. 1.) Why do colors matter so much to you? It seems as if to some of you, due to a color of one of you, you seem to feel as if you're better or deserve better treatment, or sympathy for something that happened literally over a century ago, that none of you were even involved in! I'm all for keeping track of history to keep it from repeating, but do you humans really feel the need to continue on about it despite none of you even being around to be a part of it? (I am not just referring to slavery, I'm referring to Nazis, Fascists, Anti-semetics, or really anybody who seems to think that they're better due to any of those minor differences such as a color or who you decide to worship) Do you really want to sit there and obsess over what other humans say, when you clearly know that's its incorrect and immoral? If you know it's incorrect and immoral, why do you want to censor it, when you can crumble their arguments by showing how immoral and incorrect they are? It doesn't make sense to me. You're all one race, the human race, but yet you decide to allow something as simple as a color or who you worship divide you? 2.) I understand that there are fundamental differences between left wing and right wing people, but what ever happened to a fair, and honest election? Why do you all feel the need to constantly point fingers at one another or even come to something so far as violence over something that violence will not ever change? Why do you feel the need to get violent at all, when a great man once said, ""Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Such is the same with hate, only love can drive it out."" that man, was Martin Luther King Jr. and he was a great man, who only wanted to correct humans on their obsession with colors and now it seems as if that logic needs to be applied to more than colors, it needs to applied to just about everything. Your human society is so corrupt that people can't just admit when they're incorrect and if you do come across an actual decent human that has the ability to do that, people seem to refuse to move on with their lives and just want to continue to bring it up for years afterwards. If you're in the wrong, can you not just admit it and move on with life along with everybody else? I mean, you only have so much time on this planet before you die, is that really the way you want to spend it? Do you humans really want to spend the rest of your time on this planet doing nothing but arguing with each other, pointing fingers at each other, and refusing to admit when you're wrong and have the rest of you humans have the capacity to move on with life? Is that even a life worth living? Is a life full of conflict and strife really a life? Are you truly living if you're behaving like a modern day, typical, petty human? I know that there's good out there, it just seems to need to find it's way out of the darkness and then bring light back to eliminate it."
I can't belive it... I can belive that you choose to talk about the G20 protest before than speaking about the Venezuela protest that I have been asking you for months. I am angry at this moment and maybe I will go too far but I belive you simple don't care at all... maybe you only care about first world countries but the rest doesn't deserve your attention. You keep disappointing my honest ask for help for Venezuela.
8:21 well this looks pretty cut and dry.
"I feel like Lauren southern and people like her, who show up to events, specifically to get a negative reaction. In fact want to be attacked. They show up, go directly to the opposition, wearing shirts that they know will ""trigger"" people in the hopes that they will get mildly assaulted. So they can then use that to further their narrative, ""look who's violent, look who's really the fascist, not us""."
"Phil can you also wish for a ""Hope you have a fantastic Tuesday and Wednesday"" as in the day that released and next day, since I believe quite a few of us from Europe so we usually have to watch next day comparing to you."
So people are mad that the Russian government showed you Hillary is a criminal. I don't get it so you would rather want less information about your candidates. (if the Russians even did).Now I am from South Africa and I would love if someone tries to educate our people on our e government and all of their criminal activities.
"Left and the right are always gonna fight bc they ""attack"" their entire group when they only want to go after the extremes. It's like if someone wanted to slap your sandwich out of your hand when they wanted to tell you that there's mold on yo bread."

"It's cute how forgot to mention that Fusion GPS (Clinton connected firm) is responsible for Steele I.E..""The Trump Piss"" Dossier and they are refusing and actively stalling their interviews/ testimonies before Congress and won't turn over their Emails. But, Hey I'm so glad and I love that Progressives and  leftists are still digging in on and choosing to focus all their attention on this Trump-Russia collusion myth, Because it is just leading the majority of the Democratic Party right off a cliff into lunatic extremist land where parties go to die and they are paying absolutely no attention to real issues that the majority of Americans  prioritize and recognize as having the greatest affect in their lives. Or maybe that's because the Russians have hacked our minds now and made us care more about jobs and prosperity and security for our children's futures, O and that minor little thing called AVOIDING NUCLEAR WAR WITH RUSSIA!"

"Yes, I have biases, I am technically a ""libertarian"" or whatever, I just believe in freedom of pretty much everything, but not to the point of murder and such, I am not a fanatic we still need government, but even though I am more biased to the right side of the political compass when people are obviously doing some shady stuff, it ought to be pointed out, whether it be emails or emails or more emails, because everything that is controversial has to have emails now for some reason"
Trump Jr went into the meeting with the intent to help his dad with the election by colluding with Russia. That should not go left unpunished or else what's stopping anyone else like him to do it again. *punish feels kinda weird here but I couldn't find another word
"During the filming of the first Planet of the Apes in 1967 the special makeup effects crews noticed something.   Regardless of the race of the actor wearing the simian costumes those people began self segregating themselves into their assigned simian group.  The lawgiver and priesthood orangutans, the scientific intellectual chimpanzees and the ape military warriors began eating and hanging out only with their own costumed kind during the meal breaks and cuts between filming.   It seems even if their true race or color is obscured humans will still naturally only intermingle with people that look exactly as they do.  That in itself should be the only important lesson learned from that film franchise."
"Again, DeFranco at his finest. Making videos about some idiot making stupid tweets, but nothing on corporations trying to repeal net neutrality again. Probably not even on his radar. After all, stuff like this doesn't earn clicks."

I may believe that people who are transgender are born in the wrong gender, but I don't believe there are 32 genders. I don't want us to backtrack and give minorities like me or women more power than white men because that's just retarded and moving us back through history.

Damn Straight Philip
"These are not fuckin protests, these are riot."
Those protestors needed Pepsi
"I'll tell you where this goes...nowhere, because our government is incapable of holding any powerful person accountable. Corrupt to the core."
"+Philip DeFranco , to answer your question if there is a legal standing against Trump Jr. While liberals are praying and hoping that the line  ""other thing of value"" in 52 U.S. Code ¬ß 30121 - Contributions and donations by foreign nationals, they are missing a critical part of The Code of Federal Regulations which makes the law immunizing Trump Jr.‚Äôs actions precisely clear: any foreign national individual may volunteer personal services to a federal candidate or federal political committee without making a contribution. The law provides this volunteer ‚Äúexemption‚Äù as long as the individual performing the service is not compensated by anyone on the campaign. See 11 CFR 100.74. For example, as the Federal Election Commission advises all, ‚Äúan individual can provide volunteer services to a candidate or party without considering the value of those service a contribution to the candidate or party.‚Äù Section 30121 of Title 52 does not apply to voluntary activity or services. The thing ‚Äúof value‚Äù must be actual money, or its transferable equivalent, not a volunteer of services or information.

I hope this helps."
"Phil, I'm tired of your bullshit! Your opinion is clearly gospel sent to us from Lord Gabe himself."
"""...other thing of value"" - power is money and money is power. When the Russians offered information that would help Trump get elected, they were offering power tantamount to money."
"Violence spreads from opportunity. No mather what a protest is about, right, left, muslim, christian, (even a sports game), there will be violent assholes who have nothing to do with the core protesters(/fans) and just want to cause trouble in the protection/anonymity of the mass.

And maybe Germany(and others) has to allow their police officers to use rubber baton rounds (which are highly effective at keeping protesters at a distance. Distance protects both sides from injuries.) and give them better equipment such as mobile blockade cars/trucks (cars with folding mesh wire fence attached to the front. These allow rapid blocking of streets without putting officers in harms way to divert the protesters. Also note: divert! encirclelment usually leads to escalation, so it has to be a last means.)

It's sad to see that many police forces around the globe do not learn and adapt when it comes to crowd and riot control."
"This is just my two cents, but as a Brit looking in on America right now, my heart breaks for you guys. I've never seen you more divided as a nation, and it sucks watching you attacking each other so viciously. I know Republicans and Democrats are never going to agree, we have the same here right now with our own Government, but not to the degree you're facing. Any time I look through Twitter on Trump's feed, it's so full of hate, and it's not just about opposing politic views, which would be fine, it's people going in to attack mode, calling others the most desparaging names they can think of and trying to be as insulting as possible. Sadly, I know it's not about to change either, unless Trump is somehow forced out (lets face it, the guy is never gonna leave on his own). Anyway, enough rambling, this is just my thoughts as an outsider looking in. You're our closest allies, and us Brits care about you as a nation, regardless of which team you support."
"I'm fed up with all this left vs right wing arguments and blaming. Nothing gets accomplished because there's too much yelling of strong opinions and extreme bias. Shitty occurrences get thrown under the categories of either left or right too quickly and we don't stop and analyze each situation. Therefore, people get angry over a bunch of oversimplified, inaccurate bullshit. For example, you can't really say the left vandalizes and destroys property because it has been assumed that Antifa is leftist. Antifa is not fascist or general leftist. It's anarchist. Shit's never going to get done if we keep thinking like this and not taking effort to understand logical perspectives and offering solutions."
4:45 ...and to YOU i am saying: They are just not doing what YOU think they are doing.
"it's not derays fault, he lives in a world where if your not offended by everything your a garbage human being...

"4:12 Phil you are missing the point here.
We do have a problem with so called riot- tourists here in Germany (and other parts of europe). They could not give one fuck about ""the cause"" or ""any cause"". They aren¬¥t even left wing or right wing, for the most part. So you can¬¥t ""educate"" them to further ""their cause"" better. They have none.
All they do is swarm in and hijack any opportunity they see, to destroy and get their rocks off on the mayhem. Google the original German term ""Krawalltouristen"" to get a picture."

"So Trump Jr. scooped the NYT...bad boy, didn't let them get their free pound of flesh first.  Also, what U.S. political campaign does not try to find dirt on their opponent.  
Why is it the DNC will not allow the FBI to examine their servers.  Maybe they'll find evidence of Russians colluding with Hillary's campaign.  Remember the report Bussfeed release of ""Trump's"" Piss and Poo Party which the former MI-6 operative sourced from Russia and reportedly paid for by a Hillary donor.  Or how the rape allegations against Trump appeared in three different media formats over a single long weekend.  We know that the morally incorruptible DNC and Hillary wouldn't go for dirt.  I call BULLSHIT - oh yeah, remember the DNC and CNN got caught feeding debate questions to Hillary. 
As for legality, I'm not a lawyer but I'm seeing some very very broad interpretations/readings of some legalese. Good luck with that.  So far the Russian investigations have yet to turn up any smoking guns. Investigations: voter polling machine hacking; the Hillary email hacking; the DNC server hacking and now direct Russian government manipulations.  7-9 Months worth and yet little or nothing to show.  
But hey, the DNC, CNN and other media outlets are benefiting."
"Philip, Have you ever heard of the term ""opposition research"". Your comments made it sound like you never heard of it. It has been going on since Roman times. Both sides do it and it is not wrong, immoral or illegal. It doesn't matter if it comes from a source in a different country.

"Your Analysis of the Trump Junior controversy was awful and desperate in you're trying make it seem as if he did something illegal or morally Wrong! Saying this woman is a Russian government official is like, If things were reversed and someone said an American Citizen who was  County prosecutor or Defense Attorney that worked for the State or something similar, And claiming if that person meet with a candidates son then people claim; This son meet with a Government Official of the U.S. to conspire.

It's even more retarded than the Obama is a Muslim thing....Anyways, I appreciate your balanced coverage of this topic."
"In my opinion Trump working with Russia to prevent War is a good thing. Am I missing something? Hillary wanted war with Russia, FACT. Russia passed this info along to someone who might use it to prevent war, maybe fact. Hillary and the Clintons have long colluded with the Saudis, FACT. The Saudis have a miserable human rights record, and are pretty fucking evil imo. Me, personally, I would be more concerned with the Saudi connection than the Russian connection."
"Hey Phil. Regarding the G20 Protest in Hamburg. The attacks were much worse than just reactionary anger. Members of Antifa stored Rocks on Rooftops and threw them on Policeofficers that were passing. They burned down Cars simply because they could. With Antifas cover up, blame others mentality, I and a lot of other Germans do not see Antifa as righteous people defending the small guy. It speaks volume when people call them out as what they are ""Domestic Terrorists"". They are Anarchist under the guise of Social Justice. There are even reports of Anarchistgroups meeting in Hamburg not to protest but to Destroy. The German Media even called them something along the lines of ""Chaostourists"". The Real BAMFS of the Day after the Protests were the Citizens of Hamburg coming together and cleaning their streets and Neighbourhoods. Love and Community was shown. They came together because they loved Hamburg and cleaned the streets of their city. They deserve much more respect than any ""Freedomfighter"" or Anti fascist that assault random people.
Even some Local and National Newspapers called out the people throwing rocks and assaulting people. Some even came forward and got arrest after they were exposed for beeing dicks. 
We do not tolerate chaos and assholes trying to tear us apart no matter what political affiliation they have."

The way Phil pronounced Deray made me cringe
I've spent a good 45 minutes to be apart of the discussion and talked myself out of certain areas for better reasons. hope you beautiful bastards have a great day tomorrow
"Some facts people need to fucking swallow:
1 Antifa is a terrorist organisation tolerated by governments because they're both socialists (as opposed to tolerating right wing groups like identair).
2. Therese's no such thing as Islamism, extremism, jihadism etc., there's only Islam, and every single FUCKING COUNTY Islam got into, in the course of decades became Islamic and disturbingly inhuman, with third class citizens (""impure as urine or feces), misogyny, public executions, etc. Read the history of the middle east, unless you just can't accept it. Btw to all blacks still lamenting slavery, read about Islamic slave trade of blacks in that same time span (to which THE WEST put an end to), let's say there's a reason why there are no blacks in the middle East..
3. Most politicians in the West are socialists bordering on communism thanks to neo Marxists having infiltrated the educational systems. Beware of what your child is taught (especially Canadians).
4. Communism and socialism would work if man was a blank slate at birth, he isn't! A lot of research since the sixties proves this. Some people are better than others, that's why they got more shit. The whole ideology of the left would be discredited if society aknowledged that research, hence the active denial of science on the left.
5. There's no such thing as communism/socialism without eventual authoritarianism and millions of deaths. READ. FUCKING. HISTORY. There were like ten countries that became Communist and every single one of them degenerated into hell. Human nature does not allow it, and that is good.
6. Anyone who says ""that was not real communism"" is actually saying ""if I was the dictator we'd have paradise because I'm so perfect"", and we know who said that before, Stalin.

Get educated! There is a war going on around you that you ignore because it takes courage to aknowledge it. Don't be a fucking coward and read what happend, what happens, and what might happen if we do not do something."
"BLM= black supremacists. They are racists, it's sad people like this are in this world."

Nazis were the good guys. If commies hadn't caused bullshit in Germany then no one would have risen up against them. If you have a problem with nazis there is a high chance your teachers were communists that didn't tell you the whole story. Look up red revolution of Germany.

Can you please talk about the new video thats trending about parents talking about masturbation to their own CHILDREN? Please thumbs up so Philip can see this and create awareness!
They're focusing way too much on Hillary. There are much more important matters they can focus on.
I'm kinda high rn and had this weird thought during the show of what if Phil never showed his hands during a show. Like how weird would that be?
hillary colluded with ukraine.. why is no one talking about that?
"I don't see what the big deal is, honestly. If Trump or Hillary gained information from an outside source that would suggest to the public that they are unfit for presidency, I'd want to know about it. As long as the information was genuine, I really don't care where it came from. What are the Democrats arguing against here, exactly? Are they angry Hillary could possibly have been exposed for something dark and dirty? Would they rather remain ignorant as long as they could count the result as a victory? This seems like a non-issue. 

If someone claiming represent a foreign government e-mails you and announces that they have sensitive information to expose anyone in the government, I don't care whose side they're on; EXPOSE THEM. We need more transparency in politics. If you have something that deep and secretive to hide, maybe you shouldn't be president. Let the people know. Give us all of the information possible so that WE, as citizens, can cast a truly educated vote."
I hope The directors of planet of the apes don't come out and apologise for the poster.
"TIL what ""identitarian"" is. It's a person that is part of a conservative movement in Europe that what's to return to traditional values and is ant-immigrant among other things."
I'm more than happy to let Hillary go to jail if she did the same thing Jr. did. Two wrongs don't make it right. LOCK HIM UP!!!
"To be fair, if some guy complaining about a movie is going to be enough to make you lose sympathy for issues of police brutality, you probably were never sympathetic in the first place and nothing DeRay McKesson or anyone of the like could say to change that."
so how does a news source LEGALLY obtain someone's private emails?
The pro-war media is mad Trump made a deal with Putin in Syria. They are never happy unless we are pushing for war with Russia and Syria. The only time they were positive about Trump is when he did the Syrian missile strike. The pro war corporate lying media is still trying to get the world destroyed.
The Trumps makes nixon look like a saint.
"Re: The Trump Jr. story, I find it hilarious that people are treating ""sharing info on illegal activities of a politician"" as a bad thing.


Because everything is a bad thing when someone named Trump does it."
"I'm truly glad you hammered home the point that these Extremist, violent activists are KILLING THEIR CAUSE! 

To me, this is the single greatest hindrance to all civil rights movements. 

I hope that everyone, especially those who are devoted to the BLM cause, recognize the serious problem these people are causing and distance yourself from them. The more they lash out with violence or unreasonable comments the more the rest of the world will associate these movements with dangerous juvenile idiots. 

Remember what MLK stood for, PEACEFUL protest. The fact that he was the most effective activist of all time is telling.."
antifa is just the satan spawns of the world
"Can we shoot the ""black lives matter"" people? is it legal? because 1) I am becoming increasingly intolerant of idiots. 2) it should be ""all lives matter"" not ""black"" they supposedly righting wrongs for black people but when in reality they're encouraging the divides between ethnicity. Its kinda ridiculous if you ask me."
The way the word Nazi is used today is an insult to people who lived during WW2 especially Holocaust survivors
"why to seek help from the other countries in the campaign, this is so low... for both sides, it is like ""sharing"" the USA issues with them, yikes. I dont think this is a good idea."
Lauren southern and her friends are nazis
The grammar in those emails is what pisses me off the most.
"I always say your opening out loud with you. ""SUP YA BEAUTIFUL BASTARDS!"""
(Online Dictionary) En¬∑trap¬∑ment- the action of tricking someone into committing a crime in order to secure their prosecution.
"Let's go.

1. Planet of the Apes. I have never heard if the guy complaining about it being him, I am guessing those within the movie are the same. 
2. The word Nazi is banded about so liberally these days people think it mean something about those with  a right wing view. It doesn't, it was a political movement that now no longer exists and it always seems that it is the left who batter fuck out of the right because they are better. I do not lean either way and think describing yourself as a political entity is stupid.
3. I am bored of any story about Trump and Russia. Russia did not get the man elected. The American people did that. Suck it up and sort your fucking country out. The cold war is over. Russia are not an excuse anymore."
Yo but how bout we drain the swamp that's actually in office and in control of the free world first?????!?!?!?
I don't take your words as gospel because gospel is shit
But CNN said the protests were peaceful.........
Who's still wait for to be arrested
So basically Trump Jr has been saying  this whole time that the Russia narrative has no base but he actually tried to collide with Russia and failed?... OK.
"In criminal law, the burden of proof is beyond a shadow of a doubt. As far as how it looks, maybe there was collusion, maybe not. I'd take that over a politician I know is breaking the law."
"Still waiting for Hillary to release her bleached emails, but I only can hope"
"Saying information doesn't have a value is a paper thin argument.  Governments use information as bargaining chips, weapons, and leverage all the time. While the value may not be seen by you because maybe the information doesn't benefit you, it still is worth a lot to those who pursue it."
"It would be very profitable to make a compound which simply makes affected people extremely calm, as if to completely stop their brain able to feel anger. Although this might go horribly wrong as may have addictive possibilities..."

"First of all ... I'm not american, so take what i say with a grain of salt. However, my countries minorities also face somewhat similar issues that blacks do in america. They are sentenced for longer jail times than whites do. They are living in poor areas, and have access to terrible schools and are often segregated from whites. My country takes it to the extreme where they are put in the same schools where we send our mentally disabled. The system in general makes it extremely difficult for them to get out of poverty. From what i have read, there are some similarities there to what black people face. There are many issues that are worth bringing attention to and try to drive change to stop this cycle, however ... whenever someone points to stupid shit like an ape wearing a vest, and cry racism just because they happen to see someone of colour in a similar vest, that is where you hurt your entire movement because you distract people from the real issues. People cry racism so often these days, where the word is starting to lose its impact where and when it should matter the most."
"To drain the swamp and go after Trump Jr then they need to go after Mrs. Clinton and the Clinton Foundation and bring in Chelsea because her name is on the Clinton Foundation and it's missing a lot of money. So yes drain both side of the swamp. Find out where the missing money is hiding. Don Jr and Chelsea can become cellmates. üòÇ

I guess this is the new USA you don't have to be proven guilty the media just says you're guilty and it becomes fact. A Orwellian nightmare"

Philando castilo deserved what he got he reached for a gun when the officer told him not to smh
"Phil:

You've had a lot to say over the years about peaceful protests and terrorism, etc.  

And much like Labor Unions, these ideas sound good in principle but fall-appart somewhat in practice.


‚Ä¢ Peaceful Protesting = ""Waiting for the Fuckers to Die-Off"":

People in power don't feel guilty about the ways they hurt people and they absolutely don't give a damn about protests.  Power only respects power.

Gandhi's revolution is often sited as the example for this, but what nobody wants to talk about are the THOUSANDS of Indians that died in their passive-agressive struggle with England and that basically the British finally left when there wasn't anything left to lookout that didn't have blood on it or smell of death.

East Germany, before the fall of communism, could just as easily have gone the other way and those well-armed soldiers might have just mowed-down their protesters.   Honestly, the reason they didn't might well have been the knowledge that the status quo was bankrupt and it was a good time to switch-sides.


‚Ä¢ Armed Resistance (i.e. The American Revolution, French Revolution, etc...) gets the Fuckers out, but plant the seeds for the next wave of fuckers:

People ISIS, the Khmer Rouge, Nazis and the Bolsheviks arise and are only able to gain power because of imbalances and injustices in the societies they exist in.   Imperial Powers (like England and the U.S.), exploit people and create their own destruction (i.e. the 'Dot' on either side of a Ying Yang, that grows to destroy its oppressor).  While their rage is often misplaced, and they create a lot of collateral damage, don't for a moment fool yourself into thinking you wouldn't do the same thing, if you were in their place.  


In this age, a few people own half the world and represent a very real existential threat to the rest.  The 'Individual' has become WAY too important, and balance must and will be restored one way or another.

Fortunately, the average person in the world today is finding that ""Voting with your Wallet"" is possibly the most powerful protest their is, and we also face the very real possibility of currency-collapses that will reset the game (actually this is likely the best possible solution to world problems - as it simultaneously destroys ill-aquired wealth/power, and defangs dangerous authority).


The simple truth is that life doesn't work, unless it works for everyone over time.  

""Everybody's worried about stopping terrorism. Well, there's a really easy way: stop participating in it."" 
‚Äî Noam Chomsky"
The monkey was wearing a prettier vest.
"So, let me see if I got this right... random non-US citizens claim they have valid, reliable, factual information that Hillary Clinton is basically the worst person in existence... to which a US citizens responds with, ""Hey, great, go ahead and send it on over!""

...and the crazy Democrats somehow think this is damaging to Trump?!  I mean, maybe if you could prove that the information provided was, ya know, a fabrication... but let's not kid ourselves here.

There is a HUGE difference between supplying fabricated/fake data with the intention to MANIPULATE an election... and providing REAL, FACTUAL data that would EXPOSE CORRUPTION and make the election MORE HONEST!

Other countries ~do~ have a vested interest in keeping American politics honest and ANY country or person certainly has the right to provide REAL, FACTUAL data that could potentially EXPOSE CORRUPTION or LIES within our system."

The Right gets upset when Trump is portrayed in Julius Cesar but the Left says its art. Now the Left is upset because an ape wares a vest in a movie... Isn't it art??
Congrats on the 5.5 M.
"The ape in question is called Bad Ape (a name given to him by his upbringing) who grew up in a zoo, completely around humans. It makes sense that he would be wearing human clothing, as he grew up in a human environment. Also the nod to the original."

"The point of the 8k man black block was to intimidate those that don't agree and embolden those who have and have yet to participate.

What is it with people calling other people Nazis today.  Do people truly believe that they are apart or a supporter of the National Socialist German Workers' Party?

"Where will the Trump Jr story go?  Nowhere.  If we have learned anything from the Hillary and Trump scandals it is it is long as people in power do not wish it to be so, nothing is illegal and no one will be held accountable.  
We have seen it time and time again, real punishment is for the masses not the elite.  We see it in the police force, we've seen it in government, we see it when a CEO is allowed to resign or retire instead of being fired for something illegal."

I love the idea that the trumps are just as bad as a Disney straight to tv movie and couldn't figure out how to collude.
"Phil, if you do actually somehow end up running for president in '24, don't run as an independent. Create a new party called 'The Bastards' and you'll have millions of Americans immediately register. Honestly your coverage of left vs right, Donald vs Hillary has made my stance so much easier with people trying to push me to support either one."

Two wrongs do actually make a right don't they?
Trump's whole family is mad corrupt.
Antifa should be labeled a terrorist group imo
"I do not think the new Planet of The Apes movie has anything meant to disrespect anyone or any movement within it what so ever. If someone is actively looking for something, they'll find it.

"people are programed for pattern recognition. people have more media than ever in their face. people have instant access to all other people. more people are offended by everything. where is the mystery. stop reporting on it as if ""people"" are a majority or even close to it."

"Honestly, I'm just sick and tired of trump in the news. Everyday every new station has a story on him, whether it be Twitter or something else-sometimes stupid, sometimes not-he's done. Can't we go one day in mainstream media without saying the word, 'Trump' anymore? It's frying my brain..."
"How is it a crime to investigate Hillary Clinton for a possible crime?  Dems do it to Trump all the time.  Not only that, but neither of the russians are employees of the russian government and have zero right to speak on it's behalf, so why is this even an issue?"
sorry but what about the 'russian government helping trumps canpaign' bit?

donald trump j lookin like gob from arrested developement
Spot on as usual Phil
It doesn't hurt their cause. Left extremist don't have a cause. A lot of them even used to have swastika tattoos. Their idiology is so close to the one of right extremist. All they want  is to distroy without being caught.
those fucking retards make me want to crawl into myself and disappear
commenting to achieve my dream of being on the friday show. didn't know what else to comment about though :(
They will not leave it alone it's going way to far. The social justice warriors should fking just leave people alone.
"look, we black people dont give a fuck about Deray! hes a fucking moocher and fucking is out for himself."
"i dont wanna be that guy but the whole D.Trump Jr. this is bullshit, its not even illegal and he ended up not doing it. so lets be honest here, they only care cus its the side they didnt choose. who gives a fuck about morals lol this is the US government youre talking about, theyre all pieces of shit even 3rd parties. its kinda sad to see people so eager to defend a system that was rotten to the core since the beginning."
"2 wrongs don't make a right; but, 2 Wright's made an airplane!"
Hey Phil. If you EVER threaten my child again... I will kill you.
Reminder Phil has a voice that can change things. Force and violence is the only voice everyone else has because they are ignored. It's going to get much worse because the class divide is increasing.

"I am caring less and less about the ""news"" it's getting old."
"Um... black people ARE apes. So are white people! Humans are technically apes. A great ape to be specific. We share a common ancestor with other living apes today. All humans, regardless of how much pigment you have in your skin. 

And while we're discussing science and race here, let me point out, race does not exist. Literally the only difference between black people and white people is how much pigment you have in your skin, if you have curly or straight hair, oval, round, or slanted eyes, all of those things are a hereditary product of environment. If you're judging anyone about the amount of pigment, or lack there of, in their skin, you're an idiot. Judge people by the content of their character, not the color of their skin. That goes for EVERYONE. Black people do not get a free pass to be racist. 

And since I know people are going to bitch at me, I'm going in for a pound. Slavery in America was WRONG, no doubt about that, but let's be clear about the real history. Not all citizens owned slaves or used slaves to build everything as some would have you believe. Slavery in America was more of a southern thing and they were mostly used for farming on plantations, not construction work. Not only that, but many white people fought and died to free the slaves. In addition, many of the people who live in America today, are not descendants of slaves or slave owners, They just aren't. On top of which, NO ONE should be held accountable for the actions of their ancestors. That's ridiculous. Do you see the rest of the world holding all Germans accountable for the actions of the Nazis? No, of course not, because that would be stupid and ignorant. 

I've had about enough of this shit. Not to mention, black people are not the only people who have suffered slavery in the past. Many people of many different ethnicity have suffered slavery. There are white people being kept as slaves even today, currently. If the roles are reversed would any black person want to be held accountable for something their ancestor or someone else's ancestors did? NO. Of course not. That would be absurd. 

This whole racial tension bullshit has gotten way out of hand... and what's worse, is it's something fabricated and created to distract us, turn us against each other so we're too distracted to notice what the government and media is doing. We need to stop being divisive and start unifying again. If MLK was here today, I'm sure he'd be disgusted by the racism of black people towards white people in this country. This whole SJW bullshit of calling people ""Nazis"" and ""Racists"" and ""Islamophobes"" and told that if they're white, cis, or male, they shouldn't have a voice is fucking RACIST and disgusting and is used to silence the opposition. We need to not be letting them get away with it. Racism is WRONG. Sexism is WRONG. Judging someone on their gender identity or their sexuality is WRONG. No matter who it's being levied against. Everyone should be allowed to criticize and speak out against an idea, an ideology, and action, etc no matter who it is, no matter if it has to do with religion or if a black person is saying it or whatever. 

That's a true libertarian attitude. When people do not have the freedom to speak or criticize, that's how bad ideas become prevalent and dictatorships take over. 

Sorry for the rant, I've just had enough of this shit. And this is coming from a person who is a part of many different minorities. I'm a half Hispanic,  bi-sexual, disabled, poor, atheist.  I belong to a handful of other minorities but you get the point. I firmly believe that everyone deserves to be judged by who they are for a person, not for things they cannot help or have not had any control over. I also firmly believe that we should not encroach on other's freedoms or free will with accordance to reason and empathy. That as long as what the person is doing, does not reasonably harm another person against their will, they should be allowed to do it. I think that there's a lot of people who are not being treated with equality and respect and their rights are being violated."
"I feel like anytime you talk about trump and his team of people, you usually have a light tone with your opinion, and don't really insert you biased opinion with as much emotion or ""passion"" when you talk about other people or topics, you definitely have a biased way of inserting your opinion. For example, you seemed way more pissed off  about the Deray Mckesson story and how he was wrongly offended, than TRUMP'S SON TALKING TO A RUSSIAN LAYWER DURING HIS CAMPAIGN. Deray is hurting his cause, than what the fuck is Trump doing? I mean people go re-watch this video, and see how his tone changes about his opinion on both stories. He seems more passionate and angry with his opinion on Deray, than the Russians talking to Trump's son, and HIM ADMITTING  TO IT. You gotta be careful watching youtubers reporting news..."

"""It makes your cause seem intolerant and violent"" - well, yeah, THAT'S what Antifa is. They are really no better than the fashist they claim to be against, they only position themselves on the other end of the spectrum. Whereever these people show up shit escalates. Every damn time. I heave seen hundreds of headlines where Antifa ""protests"" turned into violet riots, not once have I heard these guys actually do anything GOOD for once. 

These are the kind of people who yell ""ACAB"" and paroles like that, but then cry when they get beaten down for burning cars of working class people. It's time they're declared a terrorist organisation. As a german I'm pushed so far, I rather see protests of the current right wing people than these fucking assholes. Because ironically when the ""Nazis"" protest these days, it's more peaceful than these idiots. ... never thought I'd say that, will probably get arrested for hatepeech soon. Bye."
"Obvious that Don Jr. lied. I really don't think gagging foreign nationals from sharing  information, damaging or not, about American political figures is what, ""... not, directly or indirectly, make a contribution of a thing of value."" is there to prevent. If we extend it to this case then we swing open a door for it to be applied to any foreign government that stated a fact that could have ""contribution value"" to one side of the campaign or the other. I can see how things might get mucky if the information was in exchange for money, or something of value, which it doesn't appear that it was. I'm no lawyer, just a fan of reason."

"Jesus Phil. Every fucking video, you pick out one example of leftists doing something and you give the right wing propaganda version of that story. Then you go through, regretfully report on the terrible things that are happening around the presidency and try to undercut it at every pass. You completely neglect any positive movements coming from the left and you defend racists (or bullshit artists with a right wing following) like Lauren southern Sargon and Dave Rubin. I honestly can't tell if you were taken by the support of the general YouTube 'skeptic' community or if it's a willful anti left philosophy you're pushing, but you've become an unreliable source feeding the shitty discourse on YouTube. I'll stay subscribed and I'll try to watch your videos because I think it's healthy to understand the misinformation that is being spread but come on man you gotta practice some real journalistic standards if you want to ever be a trusted outlet."
At least Donald Jr didn't fucking delete his emails unlike someone else... üòÇ
I'm so fucking glad global warming will kill us all soon

"Am I missing something? Was Donald Trump jr under oath when he made his first claim.? is he serving a place in office.? Why is this even an issue at all. If lies were illegal Hillary would not be able to monuver past her emails. How quickly we forget about the ugliness of this presidential election. Don't we remember all of those women that bravely came forward and  falsely accused President Trump of sexual harassment? Where are those women now? did their allegations deflate faster than Dolly Parton's titty on a rocket to the moon.? I ask you to put yourself in Donald jr's position, at this point i would think the gloves were off. I would be on alert for every whisper of dirt that pertains to Hillary, I would leave no stone unturned, even if that stone wae some Russian low level attorney with claims of low hanging fruit. I would take the meeting in hopes of finding truths to contradict the former Secretary. As it turns out this women with the so called juicy information isn't even connected to the Russian government, and her Intel was a facade to talk about an unrelated issue that serves NO VALUE. So I ask you why are we perpetuating a story that at its core is about nothing.  and as far as that "" A Thing Of Value"" jargan it is the very definition of reaching from the left, and by default the MSM, which are so clearly linked together in their agenda of labeling the whites as racist, and everyone else as victims. All the while separating the population into groups, dividing the nation, while Controlling Our Speech under the blanket notion of tolerance.  Blinded by faith, controlled through fear. Go along with the status quo, never think , don't ever grow."

"It's truly horrifying how hateful and radical the majority of people are nowadays. People on both sides of the political spectrum just completely hell-bent on their opposition's destruction. No one cares about each other anymore. The far left groups like Antifa are just destroying property and assaulting innocent people because they view them as ""Nazi's"". People in the far right going to protests with pepper spray, weapons, armor, wanting to fight people and harassing people online because of their political views. Violent, intolerant uneducated people are the biggest threat to our society today."
"Nope, Philando Castille is the guy who was too fucking stupid to stop reaching when a cop yelled at him to stop reaching, and even reached into his car window to stop him from reaching."
should have made it clear that there is no evidence they are nazis and antifa uses labels to justify violence against anyone who is against them

You are leaving out a crucial part of the story on Don jr. The Russian lawyer that said she had damaging info on Hillary is the same lawyer who leaked the fake news pee gate story. Also she was allowed into the US without a visa.
OMG BLUE VEST RACIST!
Okay but Lauren Southern is just so whiny.
"Deray is a moronic, and racist professional victim, as are the majority of BLM activists."
Well now we should all go watch Gagnamsta or whatever it's called.
did you call him dariah? lol
doesn't matter. have fun proving mensrea it's also the only thing keeping bitch hillary out of chains.  Gnight America grow the fuck up.
At this point it might be easier to find out who isnt working with Russia.
BLM should of been called The Very Sensitive Offended Special Movement.
"So, they got Jr. maybe. Okay, sure. What ties does this have to the actual Trump administration, though, is my real question that was not answered in this video. Is this Rob guy in the Trump administration, or nah?"

sounds like the Donald jr story is a big nothing burger. people want it to be something it is not and are blowing it way out of proportion

And yet I have met many folks of African extraction who get instantly triggered at the mention of our primate relatives... I am just going to leave that there."
"Do Trump supporters simply not care that Russia's government openly supports Trump, and it's now public knowledge that the Russians interfered with the election to help elect him?  Even IF Trump had no purposeful collusion with Russia and had no knowledge of anything, does the fact that Russia supports him not bother anybody ? Does that just not raise any red flags?"
"If Phil was an ""impartial reporter"" of news in WW2, Phil would be arguing that Jews are both detrimental to the German state and that Jews are innocent, being impartial when utter nonsense is the motion for debate is irrational.

Hunting the people who appeared around someone else is actually what the Nazis did in some cases. I'm just sad that these guys can't see what they're doing to a valid arguement by making it seem as violent and ignorant as the one they're trying to oppose.
"I'm liberal and if Hillary tried to collude then fuck her investigate her and charge her if she is guilty. 


But Trump supporters, Russians offered to provide information to the trump that was 'incriminating' for Hillary.  If Donald trump Jr planned to accept that information and relay it to the Trump campaign (Trump Jr is basically part of it but I suspect isn't technically as a safeguard for these sort of legal accusations) then it is collusion.  Trump Jr responded 'if it's what you say I love it especially later in the Summer' clearly showing he did indeed want the information. 

Never mind all the other evidence against trump..."
dude i remember when i loved see you again and was so excited when it got 1bil
where were all these people with the Killary emails?
"At thi point being russian is a crime. Not xenophobia at all. You americans be crazy and paranoid. Where was this interest when the emails about the dnc came out? Zero investigation and showing them off. Didnt fit the narrative. Still nothing. You trow colluded around , but colluded with what? doing what? Exposed the lies of the dnc? is that the crime?"

"Black Lives Matter began as an extremely useful movement and the protests sparked conversations that needed to be had for the issue of equality in America. But so many people have bastardized the movement to scream ""racism"" at the most insignificant things. Black lives matter, but #BlackLivesMatter doesn't matter."

The first thing he found for warmth, just happen to be blue. Remember that disclaimer in movies where it says something like any similarities are unintentional...."
Dude you totally understated the importance of that email chain. This actually shows the direct efforts of the Russian government to collude and the seemingly lack of concern from the administration. You didn't even show his response to the final email.
Ahh the email give and the email take away.
"Whether you may¬†only killed one person and another may have killed two makes no damn difference you yourself are still a murderer.

She's not in a position to knowingly and through shear ignorance¬†expose the¬†country to¬†potentially catastrophic danger, set us back to the 1950s or make us¬†just a puppet of a foreign government."
"the second you harm or damage a thing or person place or thing, you are no longer a protest group. flat out the riots, hiding behind the protest label, need to stop. left right and mental are all hurting the whole of intelligence."

EITHER WAY, HITLER PROBABLY WORE A BLUE VEST TOO, SO; WOW, RACISTS. 

WAIT . There are APES in this movie?!?!1?/ RACIST."
"it's a damn movie, why does everyone get triggered by the most little things?"
Indendwwhat?
This is why I voted Libertarian lol
Isn't it racist to compare a gorilla to a black person? But when a black person compares a black person to a gorilla the gorilla is racist? Hmmm
"I think you should care about the emails no matter your political alignment. 

If Trump Jr. called a meeting with two other Trump campaign officials to meet with a Russian simply because he thought the Russian would come forth with information damaging to Hillary, that's collusion. We should care about that because it's an attempt to meddle with our election process, a vital part of our democracy. If you are truly an American patriot, then you should care about the ill precedent this sets. It doesn't matter if he got the information or not. If you went to a drug deal and the dealer turned out to be an undercover cop, you wouldn't fight the arrest by saying ""YEAH BUT U DIDN'T ACTUALLY DEAL ME THE DRUGS THO.""

Also, yes, if Hillary is guilty of collusion in the same way, I'm pissed about that too, and I think she should be punished just like Donald Trump Jr. should be. Collusion and attempting to undermine the integrity of our democracy simply to gain an advantage over a political opponent should be punished regardless of the party that commits the act, and any American who actually cares about our country should be on board with protecting the nation we claim to hold dear. 

It's sad to me that so many seem to put aside their morals and ethics in situations like this simply to protect a political party or entity that, let's be honest, doesn't give a shit about you unless you actually affect their bottom line, which 99% of us don't."
"Most viewed youtube music video by... some guy I dont know who the fuck it is! I dont listen to PissKalifer or whatever that weird shit is, lol."
"Wait so were all of those youtubers identitarians? Or did they just notice that one of them was and assumed the others were too? What happened was bad either way, but a blanket assumption would make it a bit worse."
"As far as the Planet of the Apes story goes, I think it's not a stretch for people of color to see racism in everything, because sometimes much of their experience has been white people interacting with them only through the lens of provable, actual systematic racism. In a 'free society' where a black man can be shot for quite literally ANY reason, by police and without consequence, any situation black people see as a slight against them has a certain validation. You know?"
"Congrats to Mia Khalifa for the most video on Y...oh, it's Wiz Khalifa..."

"Those Antifa groups aren't ""Hurting"" their cause. This is their cause. Use of Violence and Authority to create a single minded society. Sounds quite simmilar to something eh? Antifa is a terrorist Group! They really act just like Nazis... Seems like some people are going back to their Authoritarian roots!"
"Antifa is one of the worst groups to be formed. They are scared crybabies who call anyone that disagrees with them facist even though they support communism, which is actually way worse than facism"

I skip all the trump news
"Interesting when Donald Trump junior potentially breaks a law it's a huge deal but Hillary Clinton did the same thing multiple times and many do not care or know about. I am not defending Donald Trump juniors actions, But he did not receive information or a donation so he did not break the law. Also nice job being unbiased Philip."
"Well your word is gospel to the follower Philip DeFrancos Big Gay Religion, and quite frankly sir i am offended that you would say otherwise."
I swear to god society is turning into pussies and fucking sensitive af.....really planet of the apes u fucking dumbass
Protesting has lost its luster
"Antifa is a far left group in DE and honestly, they are as bad as the far left! I think anything ""far"" in politics is a bad thing... I live in Dresden, where Pegida movement have orginally began (movement where normal people protest the sudden influx of muslim refugees and undocumented immigrants) Although it is not as right central as they usually claim, and I am NOT A SUPPORTER of Pegida, ANTIFA and far left is just as bad! they are out of control and destroy properties in the name of ""equality"" and anti fascism... its a great cause with very poor and very violent execution! :("
"From my understanding of the G20 protests, it wasn't just one group. The extreme violence and looting was due to extreme left groups in Germany and it was expected that something like this would happen in Hamburg as it is the scene for most extreme left groups. Those who were protesting peacefully had few links to the alt left. That is why most Germans were groaning at the idea of the G20 in Hamburg as they knew something like this would happen, and that those who weren't anarchist would loose all the attention. Apart from the extreme left, the protests were fair and covered many issues, but it was overshadowed by the violence of groups who just wanted violence for the sake of it, nothing else."
It's funny that antifa is todays most facist group
"So if I went to America on holiday and have some money to a party, that would be illegal, as I am a foreign national giving money"

"Why does every story about the Republicans have to be accompanied by ""but also Democrats did [x],"" and vice versa. Americans need to get over this tu quoque attitude."
"I'm thinking this might backfire because if the Russians do have information on Hillary, it will definitely come out in this investigation. These shenanigans will never end."
"The photographer with his hand up broke my heart.
You know he put his hand up to protect his gear as much if not more than anything else. He apologized profusely as they hit him for the same reason. I have been there. You can drop a photog pretty easily- we don't mind to get down if someone gets crazy. That way we can protect  our camera(s) more easily with our bodies... the cameras are insured but if you take or destroy the card, the images are gone. And insurance or not, you still don't like seeing a loved one get hurt."
"Even if nothing comes from Junior's emails, he still lied on his security clearance form which, in itself, is punishable by law."
"I think it should be law that people MUST watch your channel because you're not bias unless you make it completely obvious, and you look at situations with more common sense than most I've seen my local county have! On that note, it seems that no matter what kind of collusion that the Trump administration seems to be involved in, his followers will still be as faithful as they were during the election. So I've lost all hope when it comes to the removal of Mr. Trump, but also must note that I did not support the other option either. I guess we will just have to see how this plays out."
"Oh God, where's the Secret Link? I need my daily dose of confidential internet directories!"
This channel is SHIT!!
wth are identitarians?
"I'm a simple man, I see Lauren southern I click on the video"
So hillary did illegal stuff with Ukraine and trump did illegal stuff with Russia? So both candidates were in the wrong and terrible choices for the 2k16 election?
So can we all at least agree that he lied? No? sigh
"I feel like the email thing would be more clear to some if it was changed to ""ooh you know where I can get a hit man!? awesome I'm all in"""
I'm sorry but this BLM shit needs to calm down like dude a vest LMAO like dude it's a movie about apes it's not some fuckin white people sitting around trying to be racist
"Two men in the past literally sold US nuclear Intel to Russians, and they were not tried for treason because we weren't at war with Russia. People calling this treason is idiotic. Also, there is no law about ""colluding"" in political campaigns. Its only against the law to take large donations, like Clinton did routinely. Do some research people."
Defranco always sucking trumps dick by saying both sides are bad and I'm pretty sure Ukraine didn't hack the RNC.
the trump jr thing is a side of fake fries side to go with the nothing burger.
I have no idea who the BLM guy is .... but to have such an inflated ego that you wold think Hollywood is mocking you .... its insane.
"BLM proves, yet again, that they are among the stupidest people who roam the earth."
"I find it interesting that Jr. released  the emails & Hillary deleted her's...

more b.s. from MSM"
"You know, it only seems like the BLM people are ones who truly hurt the BLM movement. Why can't you be part of a cause and also be reasonable? And before you jump down my throat, yes I am black and yes, my family and I see the ones making the news and shake our heads in defeat."
"Hi Phil, just hit the news. The Russian Lawyer that met with Trump Jr. was at a Senate hearing just one week later with the US Ambassador to Russia. Turns out she works with the Obama Administration and not the Russian government. Technically, Trump Jr. colluded with a member of the Obama admin. Kinda funny how things work."
I don't understand anything about why any of the protests were happening at the G20
I'm not entirely sure what the G20 actually is.
"What if Russia was playing both sides and only trying to further press the wedge between the right, and the left?"
I'm not a blm supporter but I do agree that there is an excessive amount of force being used in the police department but all that aside this whole thing with the monkey in a vest is soooo stupid like people are just searching for things to be offended about. Everything isn't always so serious it takes away from the things that people should actually be offended by
Black lives matter doesnt matter. Antifa doesnt matter. Both terrorist groups.
"There may be legitimate facism today, but antifa, a bunch of violent thugs who literally INJURE people who disagree with them under the guise of being AGAINST fascism, isn't the answer."
so the guy saying that's him in Planet of Apes it's like a black guy saying that's me in San Andreas because it's black guy
"How self centred do you have to be to think a background extra in a big budget Hollywood Movie is meant to be you, when you're at best a moderately well known social media commentator. Until now I didn't even know who this person was, which I suspect was a good thing as I've a feeling I'd be a heck of a lot dumber if I did."
Ape lives matter ü¶ç
This race card thing is way out of hand people can't watch a movie or their racist have to watch what you do it's as bad as the rape card just remember it's humunghus
Where do I get those lights in the back of your Video? Looks nice.
"Phil, I'm from Bucks County, right near Philly, and there's currently a big search for four boys who have gone missing since last Friday. It hits close to home since I went to high school with one of them and would love to hear your opinion. I really think this needs more attention to help find these boys!"
Black lives matter is a FUCKING joke
"Another important takeaway from this Donald Trump Jr story is that russian intelligence was testing to see if he was open to collusion, and he took the bait. The lawyer never had anything to give him so that she could have plausible deniability (see the ""Lawyer denies having any info on Hillary!!!"" stories). Considering that Jr still doesn't see that this was a problem, the russians are probably going to take another swing at him with something actually juicy. If he takes THAT meeting, then they have leverage over him, and the US has a serious problem."
"""Two wrongs don't make a right.""

Precisely. I don't care if it's Clinton's circle, or Trump's. If there's evidence of a foreign government directly colluding with American citizens running for public office to influence or manipulate our Democratic process (the tatters that remain of it, at least, as increasingly we have very little influence over our government's policy positions,) I want it investigated fully and thoroughly.

I'd be saying the same thing regardless of who it was. If, hypothetically, my candidate - Bernie Sanders - got into office, and then it was revealed that he or someone at a high level in his campaign was meeting with Chinese government insiders to dig up dirt on his political opponents... I'd want that investigated. Period."
"I really don't get why you keep complaining about the left. 

I mean sure they might be burning down parts of cities and attacking people, and they might be trying to shut down free speech for anyone they disagree with, and they might be trying to bring back racial and gender segregation, and they might be denying science in favour of feelings, and they might be courting communism and Islam, but the right is clearly worse. I mean, the right is making memes and that is terrible"
Please don't mention Philando in relation to that man. It cheapens his wrongful and undeserved death.
Could you please talk about what is going on in Venezuela?
I'm glad Phil is getting more woke as time goes by
"BLM as well as Antifa have completely lost any credibility their movements may have had in the minds of open minded people. Not only are their movements built completely on lies, they are violent radicals and appear to be diametrically opposed to some of the core values of our liberal societies."
Hey what do you normally think a cop means when he yells at you 3 times not to reach for something?
Ok if you're a black person and you try to stop someone from making a fucking movie because its about apes then you can fuck right off. You're the one being racist not the people making the movie. You're the fucking retard being racist to yourself and all other black people it's a fucking embarrassment if you do that.
"Pretty facist of the anti-fascists. Lmao, shit's like a good book."
What is an Identitarian? I am having trouble figuring out why they were attacked at G20. I'm really confused.
I will pay to see Watsky on a DeFranco podcast
fucking RUSSOPHOBES
"I don't get it, still no proof that he compromised his stance to get any favours from the Russians. Trump was an isolationist and liked Putin from a long time ago. This is nonsensical."
Funny how you said that people should hit or loot things or people but you didnt say that lauren southern isnt a nazi because she isnt
Wow Phil you really don't do a lot of research.
"Damn this comment section is full of nutters!!! They would defend a Trump turd by calling it a Snickers bar even if they saw it fall out of his @$$ and Trump said ""fake news is out to get me with their lies! It's a snickers bar!"""
Conspiracy to commit a crime is still a crime.
"Concerning the first story about the guy thinking the Planet of the Apes thing was about him, somehow? I agree with you. I'm black, and there is no way I want that guy representing me, my people,  or what goes on in our community if he can take something so frivolous and try to make some kind of controversy out of that. One of those types that if they can't find any trouble they go looking for it. When they still don't find any, they make trouble of their own. It's pointless. Why would I want someone like that representing me? No, freaking, thank you. I'll stay on my own YouTube channel. I'm not making much of a dent in views or subs, but at least I can speak what I feel."
"Oh, and the Despacito video will probably pass that Wiz Khalifa/Charlie Puth video. I feel it in my bones."
Antifa are the Nazis.
"phill i need to corrrect some of your terminology, rioter is derogatory the correct term is Non-non-violent protester"
Deep state set up
Fuck! What is wrong with my fellow Europeans. I worked in Deutschland before and I know they are ripe for a new Hitler these day but my lady Angela Merkel wanted to show the rest of G20 she has nothing to fear. Well I guess that was not the case. Keep tuned in for the German Election this year. We will see if there will be a 21st century Hitler or if they can keep it at bay and elect the next Macron (centrist/neo liberal french president). Only time will tell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Crooked hill took money from everyone the list is crazy
No offense but you do realize Psy has been around for years like since 2001 was his first album. So Psy has been around way longer than Charlie although I am very proud of him and glad his song is now number one most viewed.
"Love the shirt this time phil, looks better on you than the t-shirts you usually wear."
"Phil, I am a brand new teacher fresh out of college, and I must say that without your show (which I watch every day), I would be very closed off to information about the world. I currently spend so much of my days in preparation for the school year that I lack the time and drive to go out and look for information on my own, and the fact that you present the news in such an objective, interesting, and consistent fashion is absolutely wonderful. Thank you for what you do!"
DOES THE EMAILS INCLUDE AN ATTACHMENT? You know a video or audio recording of this meeting actually taking place?
There is no secret link of the day... Am I the only one who noticed that?
"Wow. I have to say that's probably the most balanced segment on the Trump Jr. emails I've seen all week. Bravo, and thank you!

Gonna say, it's a little anticlimactic. We've heard nothing but claims of direct Russia-Trump collusion to win the election for months on end. Now that the deepest, darkest secrets have come out through all the falsehoods, lies, leaks, witch-hunts, and falsified stories is that Trump Jr. tried once and failed. No collusion, no pipeline of damaging information."
"WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT WHY THIS LAWYER THOUGHT THE TRUMPS COULD DO ANYTHING ABOUT RUSSIAN ADOPTIONS!!??

Maybe because they knew Trump was going to win, oh but how would the Russians know that??"
oh thats who you are
should've pulled a clinton. did some favors and then got a generous donation to their charity or paid greatly for a speach. meh this whole thing on both sides is getting ridiculous.
"okay i personally think im a centrist here but the whole russia scandal is confusing me

i get that if russia hacked the election then that would be a major concern, but this meeting with russians thing doesnt sound bad at all

many candidates have outside ties, even hillary had ties to saudi arabia 

so why is this such a big thing ?"
8:59   The most believable explanation for the Russian scandal that ANYONE has said.
Bad ape
Black lives matter? More like  Black Lies Matter. No one is calling them Apes other then themselves. So if they take offense than fine! I'll call them apes since they so fondly identify as them. They definitely act like apes.
The officer was justified in shooting Philando Castile. #FakeNewsPhil
"DeFranco is such a racist. I am so a shamed that he wouldn't support BLM. #Disgusted

where's the secret link?
"Antifa is now hurting people that identify as European? Wow. 

The irony of their name never stops making me laugh."
Wow Russia was trying to show that Hillary was a criminal!!
the mental gymnastics from the left and the right is honestly hilarious.
"Antifa is just a terrorist group, the cops were WAY too soft on them."
"deray has become a deluded idiot. maybe he always was, at the beginning he seemed to be more rational, now he just picks every chance he gets to point out something that often has nothing to do with racial oppression. the left will eat itself, and I am not a right winger"
"No secret link, the fuck you trying to pull Phil?"
I understand a protest to show what you disagree with and use your voice to make a change. The moment a protest turns violent it doesn't show that it's a good cause to let your voice be heard but it makes the movement look violent and misguided.
"Good video guys. Keep it up. 
Holding both sides to the same standards has to be the way forward or ""the shit"" will never end.
I hope for your sake that you guys manage to keep that integrity as long as humanly possible.
Good luck, and I will continue to support as long as that continues."
It hasn't even been a year Trump's in office and stuff keeps happening around him. Whyyyyy? I miss the BAMFs of the day. Their news was way more appealing to me than this family running a country.
PHIL LIKES G-WATS!?!?!? hell yeah!
"Do more research: the reason Russian children can't be adopted in the US is because it was a response to US sanctions basted on a Magnitzkiy (or something like that) list which blocked many Russian officials from entering US.

So basically Russia is holding its orphans hostage until those sanctions are lifted - that is why such shady dealings involve adoption."
Lauren southern!!!!!
"There's no case to be made here that Trump Jr. acted illegally. The Clinton campaign also did not act illegally in meeting with Ukraine. Sure it's immoral, but if this was any other president or any other presidential campaign there would not have been much media coverage over this, just like there was no real coverage besides that politico article that came out 6 months ago over the Clinton camp meeting with Ukraine."
lol.......what? It's a freaking movie.
Could someone please explain to me what an identitarian is and why people the protesters didn't like them and called them nazis?
Why is he wearing a blue puffy vest in the first place. Ew.
u really dont like trump dont you philly D
"All I ever hear are the arguments on how Clinton's emails where obtained, past and present, what I haven't heard is someone saying the horrible shit in the emails are untrue! and if they are true why isn't she behind bars?"
I'm so tired and annoyed by all this Russia bullshitüôÑüôÑüôÑboth sides should stop bullshitting each other and start being productive for once
"I know this has nothing to do with any of the actually important issues, but I really don't like Charlie Puth's music (and See You Again is not very good imo in spite of meaning) so its annoying that you deem him being the top and wearing the crown as good only by virtue of beginning in YouTube, with no actual criticism or praise of the actual song. That is a very biased view. I mean, 'Baby' was the most viewed once and by former beginning vlogger Justin Beiber and people didn't give it a pass. I get people actually like the song, so it becoming the most viewed does not bother or surprise me. It bothers me that him being a YouTuber is what makes you happy. It's about the music, man.

I mean, at least Gangnam Style was interesting, visually and musically. Of course, this is my opinion."
Cute reporter
Imagine that its trumps running for reelection. Democrat candidate x is running. A Russian contacts them and says we have the goods on the Donald. Who here thinks the democrats dont go to the meeting. Of course they would. Now remember Hillary had some shady dealings with both the russian government and corporations/ oligarchs. Trumps campaign would have been stupid not to go
No secret link of the day?
Can someone explain to me what an idenitarian is. I'm not sure what it is.
"I don't think the Russian lawyer Donald Jr. met with is a Russian agent. She just went on an NBC Tonight interview where she spoke no English at all, only Russian. If she was a Russian agent working on a case this sensitive she'd be an SVR agent fluent in English and under strict orders not to disclose any information or make any statements, least of all giving an interview to a US media organization actively looking for dirt on a Russian-Trump conspiracy. Add the fact that the only connection between her and the Russian government is an Azerbaijani pop star whose family is friends with Putin leads me to believe she might've just claimed to have evidence on the Clintons just so she could get an audience with Trump Jr. and talk instead about Russian adoptions. Doesn't mean Trump Jr. wasn't actively trying to get info on the Clinton campaign with someone he thought might've been a government agent, but I don't think this is evidence the Russian government actually made contact with the Trump campaign."
When will Antifa become a domestic terrorist group like seriously why aren't they considered terrorists
Last time I checked the real Nazis attacked and silenced others
"3:00 It's really... interesting, that you didn't take the time to explain that Identitarians are a racist group. ü§î"
Are we really offended by a movie about Apes killing humans? God please just kill us all apes.
Antifa are degenerates.
Phil you're the man I love how the show is a conversation to you and you enjoy hearing feedback no matter how different the opinions are from yours .You're a great dude and I love everything you do on the channel. I support trump and the way he is leading our country and I think that don jr. was just trying to help but it's a little shady and I think he shouldn't have done what he did
"""Kimmy kimmel live""üòÇüòÇ(read the writing on the kit part)"
Derry I just to a shit if I flush is that racism at it core oh no oh no what to do #ItIsntAlwaysAboutYou
Why do people freak out about everything
Nice random unnecessary hit job on Black Lives Matter Phil. You even admit he deleted the tweet at the end. So it's a complete non story then you conflate and equate deray with that Tariq wacko. Nice job buddy. You always have a problem with race as of late. Quit pandering to your new racist subscribers.
"you probly think this song is about you, bout you, bout you......."
"I agree w/ Phil about hurting your cause with violence but there's a point when you're cause becomes domestic terrorism and when you reach that point the more violence it has, the more successful it is"
"I found it VERY confusing when you read those Trump Jr emails in reverse order.....i scrolled back several times, confused, before I realized that it was because you read them backwards (first email was on the 8th, last email was the 7th)....i might be clueless here and it's actually common practice sometimes to read these things in reverse, but personally I found it confusing that you read them in reverse order!"
THE COPS DID NOT PROVOKE THE G20 RIOTERS YOU OBVIOUS POS! Also did you just call Lauren Southern a Nazi?
Love coming home from work sitting down with some food a watching some good old Philly D
"I remember when Toronto hosted the G20 summit and rioters destroyed our downtown core, these rioters fuck up everything for legitimate protesters"
"What do you call a few thousands of people dressed in black uniform/black masks attacking people based on their supposed opinions and marching around in hamburg holding up a black red white flag? Fascists. You call them fascists. It's pretty funny that we're living in an Orwellian future considering these people are called ""anti""fa. Stop fascism, stop antifa! Increase the criminal penalty of wearing a mask during protests."
"Lauren has been attacked multiple times and yet not a single feminist group has stood up for her simply because she's right wing, this shows how hypocrite these people really are. But now the media if just around her are also getting attacked and no one bats an eye, yet you see them talking crap about antifa and other groups being attacked, as if the lives of the opposition or anyone perceived as such didn't matter. It just shows you who these people really are and how they will ignore anything just to impose their views. And btw why is it that I can go on Twitter and Facebook and tell people to physically attack others and nothing happens,    but say ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN"" and can get banned (btw no it didn't happen to me) forever?"
I love that people freak out about the fact that Russia knew about the DNC corruption and ratted them out rather than the fact that the DNC was corrupt as hell.
If I had 1 wish i'd wish that the Nazi army got revived and started terminating all these damn far lefts.
Germany lol

Trump Jnr wasnt running was he? Didnt get any money?  May have possibly asked if info that was stated to exist was available? So he is guilty of fact checking something mentioned in a conversation? SHOCK AND HORROR! Shit he is screwed how dare he go ask a question relating to something someone said. He must denounce anyone other than this odd bunch of people who think themselves infallible!
amazing the left call the right violent... Jesus christ the hypocrisy is cancerous
Just restarted my YouTube channel plz sub but anyway back to the point awesome video
"Why hasn't Antifa been labeled a domestic terrorist cell in the United States (beyond New Jersey) and these other afflicted countries? It has been made abundantly clear, just in the last year, that they have no intention of expounding upon or defending their particular political views in the public polemic, opting instead to destroy and jeopardize the livelihood and safety of people around them in order to make their stance heard. These are kindergarten levels of common courtesy they are disregarding and ISIS levels of intolerance they are adopting."
The liberals really went hard on the g20 protests this year. Constant coverage of the protests instead of the actual g20. Even the fucking mayor of NYC went to protest instead of doing his fucking job.
"The left has always been violent and intolerant. Ever hears of communist Russia, China, Cuba?"
"I realise that investigating Russia's involvement in the US election is potentially important for future elections, etc. but why is Trump still chasing this?? I mean, he got president and any supposed involvement that Russia had in support of Hillary obviously didn't make much difference. He got want he wanted so why is he chasing it because of ""election corruption"" which happened nearly a year ago??"
It sorta sounds like the kid was being manipulated by somebody.
"I would like to order a Big Nothing Burger , supersized! Now that is a T-Shirt you should cell! ""CNN, Home Of The Nothing Burger!""."
Fighting for peace is like fucking for virginity.
"i was at watskys set the day when Russell (black morph suit guy) gave him a piggyback ride. It was at Warped Tour Wantaugh, New York."
to begin BLM is just a terrible group in genera. talking about causes that don't exist and then starting problems that didn't previously exist. it's a very backwards group who I'm sure most are virtue signalling seeing that when there are protests a lot of the groups have a large margin of whites and not blacks. it seems a bit strange to me in all honesty that groups like this when other leaders talk about shooting cops and whites in the name for say civil rights in a modern age. This can be seen by BLM ralliers and activists across several plains. When it comes to Antifa in NJ they have been seen as a domestic terrorist group and I honestly hope that other state governors mark them off as such too same with foreign nations.
interesting... NOW Progressive Democrats care about Emails? amazing
"Nothing is going to come out of the Trump thing, or Russia for that matter, by this point it's just a waste of time and dems still can't find anything to make Trump quit anyway. 

However what we should be investigating is how someone can be stupid enough to question if Planet Of The Apes is racist or not, I mean really you are so self centered you see a movie about CGI apes and all you can do is find a racist connection?. 

Thanks Phil for at least being the only one not to quickly screen racism or jail on today's news and actually analyze them, btw your couch is probably racist, don't know why but screw it since everything is racist nowadays."
"I vote to get a huge thunderdome and put all people in who identify as: BLM, Antifa, KKK, Skinheads, Far-right, Far-left, ""democratic socialists,"" Nazis, Communists, Anarchists, modern day ""feminists"" (as apart from classical feminists), misandrists, terrorists, misogynists, and all associated with the Westboro Baptist Church..

Throw them all in and watch them fight to the death whilst televising supply drops that come every week."
Cancerfa.
Trump Jr. looks like Drake Bell
"Those fucking Nazi cunts bombed my family they looked sounded and acted like these nazis and they even came from the same place! If they hate Nazis they have to genocide themselves. Fucking German fucks are just a bunch of Hitler clones doing Hitler brown shirt shit to old school liberals. Actual liberals not the new liberals whom are globalist socialists. Easy fix is just ban Germans since they are actually Nazis. German language banned, German culture banned all these German fucks emolated."
"You forgot to mention at the end that, again, Hillary Clinton didn't just get ""information"" and support from other foreign governments.

She received straight up cash donations- huge sums- from foreign governments.

Fucking. Hypocrites. I don't like Trump Jr. doing it but seriously, comparing a super soaker to missile launcher here. I'll let you figure out which one Hillary is."
"This is all fine and dandy but doesn't the president of the United States [Donald Trump] possess the ability to acquit somebody, anybody, from their crimes and release them from prison, etc. I believe I've heard such that is still in effect today so if Don Jr. got tried and turned up guilty his father could just up and acquit him and then Trump's Industry would easily pay off any fines. Am I not correct here?"
"wow, it seems that shithole is trying to fix it's tarnished reputation after hitler, but in all reality, they're only further making it worse. I used to think America needs to stay out of other countries business, but now I kinda want the US to invade Germany now that it's been taken over by antifa."
It's interesting with the Hamburg protests that you don't talk about how the protests were originally meant to be peaceful and were hijacked by people from all over Europe who's sole intention was to insight violence. Instead you continued the narrative of the first story. Which I completely agree with but I don't think was the major take away from the G20 protests. But that's my opinion.
"Hey Uncle Philip, I like the show, but could you maybe do less jump cuts? it hurts my eyes and ears"
deray/tareeq have alot in common with the alt right both are pushing hard for a race war
The only thing that doesn't make sense with me is that they said there was evidence of Hillary with some wrong doings with the Russians.  So where was this information?  It wasn't leaked or talked about during the election.
"information is not a ""thing of value"" unless its you know the location to a lost treasure."
The word value there is clearly talking about monetary value
"I'm not a big fan of political stuff in general, but my opinion is this overall, I think that everyone in that world is wasting alot of valuable time on bashing each other and trying to bust each other every other day for some illegal shit instead of taking the time to shut the fuck up and work on making america great again as they say. I mean after all, by the time they bust trump on anything we will already have a new president."
"This whole entire Trump situation is a giant witch hunt. Some people won't be happy until they find something, anything that will destroy Trump. The problem that I see is that if there was anything real it would have been found already. The fact that these people keep beating a dead horse instead of trying to make a bad situation better, it's an embarrassment to the fine people of America and a black spot on the reputation of all of those who partake in it."
deray and tareeq are pond scum pushing hard for a race war
nobody owes anyone anything because of something their great great great long dead ancestors did! stop begging & crying for a handout.
"Pretty sure they DID get something from that meeting because right after the meeting took place, Trump Senior tweeted his first tweet about Hillary's missing e-mails. That can't just be coincidence."
Anyone who supports BlackLivesMatter is either ignorant of what is associated and what goes on in that group or is brainwashed.
So let's get Psy to number 1 again?
Thank you Phil. This video is great. Very GIFable.
"And I thought the election news would stop after the election. Fuck me, right?"
"Saw a monkey in the forest, fucker is copying Phil."
"A thing of value... as in how all of history, knowledge has been used as a form of currency. Especially in the early days of our ancestors where teaching how to farm, hunt and create fire was knowledge that became indispensable and to many, a form of payment for things. Guilty.."

"why did people not vote for Hillary? [IMO same reason everyone was so against another Bush] everyone is tired of 'family dynasty' 
however, either you voted for trump or not, how do you feel that he is letting his kids 'fill in' for him???"
Hi Phil been watching yo show for years. Today you talked about the The planet of the apes and the guy making a compares to the jacket. I don't like the movies cuz it seen the the apes are black ppl against white people.but it's funny how u talk about him and didn't cover or said how u feel about the not guilty verdict in that case.
"""A foreign national shall not, directly or indirectly, make a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value""
I'm no lawyer but considering the context of the sentience, ""value"" seems to imply something of monetary value, not information."
"IF the information provided to JR was of value, would JR still be violating the law as a ‚Äúreceiver‚Äù if he passed the information off to the FBI to deal with?  Is that collusion?  There‚Äôs nothing being said that JR would NOT have immediately informed authorities of Hillary‚Äôs alleged crimes."
It wouldn't have been collusion even if he got information. It's called opposition research. He lied ü§• but so what no one that matters cares. He didn't receive or solicit. They reached out to him. They solicited him. You may sound fair or balanced but you always tip left. Trump Jr is a moron for falling into the obvious trap and giving the MSM more meat to chew on. It will all go away soon anyways. Trumpslide 2020!!!
"Did blm member just compared blacks to monkeys or did i have stroke, violence does one thing breeds violence."

I want my secret link of the day!!!
Philip DeFranco lovessssss Trump!!
I just made a cake and it's so freaking dense oh my gosh. I took a bite of the extra cake I leveled off and I was full after that lol. It's for my sisters birf day. It's so ratchet. Go me!
it said Kimmy Kimmel Live
Wow blue vest = racism
"""Trump top aide"" 

I heard that misspeak Phil ;)"
Antifa is not hurting their cause when they attack people. That is their cause. They are anarchist violent revolutionaries that just want to see the world burn. Bunch of millennial pieces of shit.
bring back SUP NATION
did anyone else notice that there's snow on the ground in the pic of the Plant of the Apes movie.. maybe the ape was cold so he was wearing the vest because of that??
"Yeah, fuck Antifa. Bunch of pussies."
can we just take a moment to appreciate the sources that Phil put in his description
People throw around the word Nazi too loosely nowadays. Everyone who thinks differently is considered a Nazi. I don't think people who use the word truly understand the terrible nature of Nazism and the people who were actual Nazis. Try to use more accurate vocabulary.
I had some Maine lobster tonight for dinner
"Hey Philip, this is about the g20 protest with the right wing journalists being attacked. I agree putting their pic up and stalking them was wrong a million times over, but as someone with German family living over there and knowing how things are I slightly see where they're coming from. Over there nazi propaganda is banned, and other than schools it's never talked about because the people don't want to see their country as that ever again. I kind of see it as the whole confederate flag thing here where people got either protective or aggressive against it, but without assaulting and hunting down people. Mixing that suppression of dark history with radical left SJWs is what I think is the cause. Sad to see this though"
"There's one problem with the ""coke deal"" metaphor - it's not illegal to talk to Russians. There's no crime being alleged in this whole ""collusion"" scandal. It's all smoke and mirrors."
Now I know why I hate politics............
"well if it was a reference towards him, then they wouldn't make it the exact vest. it would be too obvious then. so basically it's impossible to know even though it most likely isn't."
"Antifa are fucked.  Least it has some culturally relevant history in Germany, but fuck off.  Fascists."
"Philando Castile... dude, the guy was reaching for his gun when the cop was telling him not too, he was a criminal, and again reaching for his gun when told repeatedly not too by a cop"

Lauren Southeren goes be he him pronouns.. how dare you assume her gender!! üòÇ
"the planet of the apes thing was too much. But I don't think there's any way to make what happened to philando castiel illegitimate. in fact I've personally lost all hope on the subject. honestly what's the point of anything we are pushing for, what's a body camera gonna do when people can be killed on Facebook live in front of their family and still the cop gets acquitted. America finds it more disturbing when black people use their bodies to stop cars then they do when our bodies are used to stop bullets."
Super Mario Odyssey and now Stranger Things coming out on my birthday? This is prob gonna be a nice birthday.
"tha internet:
I will not tolerate your intolerance so i shall punch you"
"Philip ""Fake news"" DeFranco"
I always find it amazing how you have such a middle and clear headed opinion but then your comment sections are so fucking bonkers. Wish people would actually listen to what you have to say. Love you Phil.
"5:40 you mention ""just under 2billion views for gangnam style but its more like just under 3 billion views lol."
deray is a narcissistic.
"Hi Phil - Just to clarify, not sure whether you realized you spoke about the emails in reverse. The top of the email chain was the most recent, and the final email you spoke about was the start of the chain."
LOCK UP THE TRUMPS!
Another day in millennial liberal land.
"I completely despise Trump but i'm not exactly sure where the issue lies here, we know campaigns try and dig up dirt on the other, it shouldn't exist but it does. The line is drawn where there is breaches of privacy and security. I'm not sure this crosses that line any more than any other campaign. Hacking someone's email is a clear breach of privacy and security, however someone simply having information on you isn't, unless it was gathered through certain channels."
"Damn, both candidates were so bad they needed other countries to help them out. Has America really come to this?#MakeReasonPrevailAgain"
Phil I'm drunk and I love you bitch.
Lauren Southern is a Goddess
i am past the point of... i dont care anymore.
Because Don Jr admitted to collusion? Is that why people are freaking out? Seems like that would be it.
I love being Philled in.
Who else's is in the bathroom taking a dump
"Pretty sure once cars start getting lit on fire, it's a riot. Definitely not a protest at that point. At the very least once the looting starts, it's a full fledged riot."
"I have not watched you much (twice) including this. If you do not know why it is a big deal, you need to stop talking about it until you find out. The fact you are trying to make it seem like not a big deal is a disgrace and so is your grasp on our laws about this type of thing. There is no moral front, it is all legal and they broke some serious laws including where Kushner is going to prison for 5 years. As I said, I do know about this and you seem not to, so you should learn what you are talking about before you talk a bunch of nonsense about something so serious. I would tend to think you support Trump but that does not even matter even though he has broken so many American laws and most likely is going to be impeached."
Could you explain what identitarianism is? This is the first time I'm hearing the word.
"As a right winger, I am outraged by the G20 riots, these fucking antifa terrorists should be put in jail!"
"Hate si, tg"
"a little sensitive,  bit of self hate happening there with the Planet of the apes thing"
Of course white supremacist DeFranco is happy a white guy has now the most viewed youtube video.
"LOL, same as in my country, the radical group said that they are being oppressed by others but the fact that it's opposite, they oppressed and harassed other with violence."
"The presence of peaceful protesters doesn't take away from the G20 protests being the largest Black Bloc in history, or the violence and damage caused by the rioters. The reason there is little discussion about the peaceful protesters is that they aren't an issue."
Identitarian?
"""hurting their own argument""
lmao, Antifa's argument is violence."
"Maybe BLM wouldn't be triggered by Planet of the Apes posters if BLM ""protests"" weren't riots of people going ape shit."
Good lord. People thought planet of the apes was racist?
when you call yourself an ape üëÄ
deray and Tariq remind me of all those insane groups on Facebook like Christians against tattoos! Taking  the smallest of details and making seem a thousand times worse
"Saudi Arabia funded 20% of Clinton's campaign and it was a non-issue. Nothing in that email said the information they had was obtained illegally, so if a member of a foreign government sends you information, even sensitive information, if it was not obtained through espionage then it's fair game. And it doesn't become collusion until the Trump campaign collaborates with Russia and DIRECTS them to attack Clinton or hack the DNC (which STILL has had no evidence shown to be Russia, Seth Rich anyone? This whole crap about 12 out of 12 dentists agree Russia hack Democrats uh duhrrr! Not! The person hacked wasn't even Podesta, the supposed hack didn't produce anything of consequence and that person that was hacked was hacked with a tool DEVELOPED by Russia years ago that anyone can get these days. Of course the intell agencies want to paint it as Russia they have an agenda and are too lazy to even manufacture real evidence of Russian hacking, which wouldn't even be that hard we have IP spoofing technology). How much do you think every country on Earth, probably even Russia, was giving favors to Clinton and outright funding her campaign and much of this was completely known during the election and it wasn't an issue for the media or the establishment who had already backed their horse."
The anti fascists of today are the fascists of tomorrow
"I'm a simple man. I see Lauren Southern, I click"
In my mind donald just has a gun pointed at himself and everyone around him trys to keep him from pulling the trigger but no matter how hard they try he shoots himself anyways then trys to blame them. this should be a cake walk for him other than the media bs but him and his kids/jared always manage to fuck something up or themselves over everytime  they open their yaps.
"With this whole Trump Jr and Hillary thing I feel like we need to do something funny. You know, like the police do sometimes with drug dealers like hand them slips of paper telling them they'll help get rid of their competitors if they provide the police with their names and addresses. We just need to tell Hillary and Trump to investigate each other and hopefully both issues will be solved."
Talk about the great American cookies kid who got falsely terminated
The Why People Are FREAKING OUT show
"See the thing is about protests is that they can go many ways. A lot of times during violent protests, when the police do try to shut it down, those violent protesters resort to referencing the Amendments and their right to protest, But that is the thing, we have the right to PEACEFUL protest. And violent protests DO NOT accomplish anything! Protests are supposed to be used to make a point in positive way, hoping for a useful result. For example: The Baltimore 'protest', it was caused (without getting into detail) because a black person was wrongly killed by police. The polices justification was that they felt threatened. And than the protest was violent. They were trying to say just because the victim was black does not mean he was violent, yet the protest was extremely violent. Violent protests are not helping any causes, it is damaging the chances of the change that is being demanded actually being changed. We need to stop thinking with a mindset of destruction and start thinking with a mindset of progression."
Hmmmmm Deray... He will make an issue where there is none at all... Pathetic....
People need to stop spouting bullshit about the retarded black lives matter movement.....
"soliciting requires actually asking for something. 

if someone offers you something, like, vaguelly, you ask, hey what you got, and they say ""I've got some pot, I'll be on the the corner of main and five all day"" you get there and the guy is only selling girlscout's cookies and no drugs, did you really solicit it ? 

The act of soliciting is he accepting the visit from a russian lawyer.

Also, what is wrong with a foreing country telling someone about someone else's dirty dealing ? I want corruption and wrong doing to be told, I don't even care if russian hackers need to steal that from politicians and give them to wikileaks - I don't care for the source, if someone is commiting a crime, everybody deserves to know before voting on the corrupt candidate. So, if they actually had gotten news of hillary corruption, I would still be ok with that."
"Welcome to the world where everyone is offended by everything. So stupid. Ban all monkeys, apes, chimpanzees and the like from movies and show because dear lord they may offend someone...üòíüôÑüòë Some people thrive on misery and conflict, it's literally the oxygen they breathe."
Its a monkey wearing a vest. black lives matter needs to stop getting triggered about every thing they see. Oh a white male with a boat let me shatter his knee caps with this steel rod.
"When you go to a protest, always carry. You will get ample opportunity to stand your ground and put someone in the grave in the name of self defense."
Antifa is not hurting their cause doing this because violence and intolerance IS their cause.
"Stories involving Trump, Russia, or anything else political, i try avoiding. Once you get to that topic Im out"
I support some of what Deray says but he was reaching with that comment üòÇüòÇüòÇ

I am a black male when I'm walking down the street and I see a white women walk to the other side I UNDERSTAND!!!!! WE DID THIS TO OURSELVES!!!! I understand not all blacks are bad (like me) I'm a good guy and I am respectful but if you don't know me I can look kinda trashy with the clothes I wear and having a gold watch and a chain but I am one of the nicest people you will meet. I nor my black friends have been encountered with blatan racism and I'm not talking about a 12 year old calling me a nigger on the internet. Do you know who sold our ancestors to the white people? The rich black people that lived in africa you imbiciles!!!! When I see a black person who got shot by a cop I know for a fact he did something for that to happen.

"I'll admit, when I saw the Planet of the Apes trailer during a preroll, I thought it was pretty racially coded. But go after that, not the poster. And that's just my opinion, which is admittedly pretty uninformed about the Apes franchise, so I'll let everyone else discuss it instead."
"See, the issue with the Welcome to Hell protest is that looting and rioting isn't hurting their argument. Rather, it is their argument. They are anarchists and are fundamentally against the concept of private property"
"This is related to your protest story today and all other protest stories before. I agree that words and debates are needed for complete collusion in a compromise. Speaking up about issues not only finds a solutions but also an understanding. But you usually call those that stop people from speaking opinions that are disrespectful or dangerous to another's life, crybullies. You understand free speech as you should be able to say anything no matter what even if someone doesn't agree. In my opinion it is dangerous though. We've let people, important politicians, speak their dangerous opinions before and it turns out bad. Yes, people can say ""oh that threatens me!"", and people could just shut the innocent person up. But what I like about you is the ability to know what actually is worth fighting  for and about. I just think your opinion on certain protests are too big on idolize the wrong idea of free speech."
I see a bunch a ''unconscious'' racist liberals here. HEHE !!!!:)
"Isn't pathetic how desparate the news is to pin something about Russia to Trump? It's ALL speculation, just let the investigation play out. And THANK YOU AGAIN PHIL for mentioning the actual COLLUSION we know about that Clinton and the DNC did that NO ONE on the mainstream talks about!"

"I just want to be clear here.  These ""legal experts"" are suggesting that if a foreign national has knowledge of wrongdoing on the part of a political candidate, has documentary proof of that wrongdoing, and offers that to that candidate's opponent it is illegal?  In other words the truth is illegal during an election if it comes from foreigners?  Really?  Notice that if this is true:  We will have to censor all foreign press during an election.  They would be foreign nationals with 'something of value' to either campaign offering it in a manner that could/would sway an election.  This is nonsense.  I love that the democrats aren't denying the truth of what was released.  They are crying foul that Hillary's misdeeds were revealed.  Yeah, seems legit."
I was a Trump Supporter but now This Russia shit is kinda fishy
"Funny that after a campaign blasting Hillary for emails, emails are what's starting to sink Trump"
I'm torn over the matter of using ones' fists to settle an issue. Violence is bad right? On the flip side where's the accountability when latent racists can hide beneath the label of free speech? There's no repercussions - isn't that just as bad as allowing it to fester? Ex. the nazi that was punched in the face in January... should people feel free to walk around brandishing and touting their support for groups which have wicked history?
Russia Russia Russia. Hillary gave Russia nuclear weapons.

"Honestly, every time I watch this show and hear about some of the utter insanity in the world, this applies to really any of the stories here any given day, I'm honestly beginning to wonder if I'm one of a tiny minority of sane people left in the world."
"Dunno if someone pointed that out already, but the thing is the old Planet of the Ape movies were already an allegory of racial oppression. I mean the Apes had something like a caste-system. The Gorillas were the warriors, Orangs the leaders and/or spiritual leaders and the chimps were the normal folks, workers. In the first movie Kira and her SO had a discussion that the ban on chimps getting better jobs was abolished, but some Orangs still didn't follow that."
"I find the G20 protest incidents very concerning. People should not be silenced just for having an unpopular opinion. For ANTIFA to do that is scummy; encouraging an attack on another group of people makes them no better than actual fascists. Even though I disagree entirely with the identitarian movement, I do feel sorry for these people. What are you supposed to do in this situation? You can't necessarily fight back in self defence, because doing so could get you arrested, or worse. One of the people tried to get away to safety, but was shoved again.  It's disgusting that people have this grandiose idea of being a crusader for human rights while threatening physical harm to another human."

"Everything was questionable about our last election, but I just wanna remind everyone that we shouldn't get too stressed about politics.

"I don't understand why you (Phil) cover this stuff (referencing the first story). Who cares about stupid people? When just these stories like idiot BLM people or racist Trump supporters are shown as often as they do, it makes quick thinkers have a warped view on other outside groups. Why is it even worth covering? Just to say ""hey look at this idiot, he's wrong for x reasons"". No hate to the show, I just dislike repetitive stories like these. It's such a minority's of ignorant people who always get the spotlight. I understand every once in a while when it is a really big influencer cough*president*cough, but not every god damn person verified on twitter."

Please."
"You read the Trump Jr. emails in the reverse order - it's chronologically backwards, so the first email would be the one at 8:12. 

It's more incriminating when read in order, as Goldstone opens by talking about the ""Crown prosecutor of Russia"" and ""Russia and its government's support for Mr.Trump,"" to which Trump Jr responds that he's ""loving it"" - and then follows the back and forth of them trying to hammer out a date to meet."
i love getting stuckmannized right after getting philed in

Your forgot that the journalist at G20 actually tracked the whereabouts and locations of these identitarians too.

"as someone who identifies as an anarchist, i am sickened by antifa and their actions. they have done nothing but wave the black flag while oppressing others. they are twisting the philosophy to justify heinous actions against innocent people. they wave the black flags without even realizing how many fought and died for the idea for freedom for all men, women, and children. regardless of race, color, or identity. it sickens me. they arent anarchists. theyre facists wearing a mask."
Deray is mad because they used his likeness in the apes movie.
wow a monetised video
antifa has been categorized as a domestic terrorist group in my state of New Jersey. All 49 other states should follow suit.

"Why isn't the real story here ""Who dox'd Donald Trump Jr. to get the emails""?"
"the monkey in the blue vest its a fictional work of art and if you go around thinking it was made to somehow relate to your ugly mutt then that's your problem. lol 
its kind of like when people hear a song on the radio an say ""OMG! they are play My Song!"" well guess what its not their son, so don't compare your self to fictional characters because I can a sure you they have nothing to do with you or anyone else for that matter, stop calling your self African American or Mexican American or what ever other nationality you may be, and the rest will follow. I guess what I'm trying to say is people need to grow up! it the 21st century act like it is, because in the end we all matter and we are all the same.

but that's just me and I could be wrong for I have being known to make mistakes.

like your channel Philip"
"My spouse finally listened in to this episode. We were both crying when your spot on Trump Jr came on! Cocaine to candy bars lol! I think the Girl Scout cookie event is my food crack, so it made SO much sense. Keep it up!"
"You didn't show up on my feed today, had to look up today's vid ;("
he should really talk about weed laws and how even though they made it legal in a lot of States they're making it almost basically a monopoly is set of these news stories that pretty much don't affect most Americans anymore or out of the state

"Hey Philip!! I'm a Canadian from BC and bouncing off the walls right now, surrounded by wildfires!! Just wanna say thank you for your videos! And giving me a little escape from stressing the eff out! You rock! Have a kick a$$ day! Shyloe!"

"I wish I had time to watch a movie, let alone complain about a movie because of a blue vest.  Cucks need jobs."

"these stupid idiot SJW's are assholes, they dont know whats really happening, what they should do and is this the right way to do?(not talking about victims here) everyone keeps adding more fuel to the fire instead of extinguishing it"
sellout........ quit showing up on my recommendations
'Preaching tolerance with your fists.' Well said Phil.
So Trump Jr. is just another corrupt elitist like everyone connected to politics? Color me surprised lmfao üòÇ. I honestly can't name a single bureaucracy or corporation that isn't slightly corrupt or invested in behind the scenes matters that they would want kept secret at all costs.

"Why do these people always have to make everything about themselves?. Smells like good old attention seeking narcissism to me.

 It's a movie - the apes look like apes. The fucking end."
"So, what you are saying is, Trump should have set up his own ""Trump Foundation"" and any foreign national can contribute millions of dollars and he is good?"
"That second story was a bit confusing- I feel like I missed a huge intro to it. What is an indentarian, what was this protest about, where was it, etc"
"both Hillary and Trump are guilty, information is power therefore it is very valuable"
"In my humble opinion, if there was factual evidence of a Clinton involved exchange with the Ukraine then Trump would have been obligated to seek truth, be it beneficial or not to his own campaign efforts. So essencially we're talking about a conflict of interest. Lets say a credible source solicits trump that there are key connections incriminating Clinton of treason by collusion with ISIS (this is fantasy) by going to the head of the FBI (an institution whos head was appointed by POTUS that actively was endorsing Clinton) how far would that investigation have gone? It would have been shitcanned before ever taking off. The FBI would have ""made a mistake"" and blown the whole thing purposefully. Legally i cant defend the allegations but on a moral standpoint yes its absolutely credible to have acted in that manner."
"Phil what are you doing?  
I was going along with you when you said Jr acted like he wasn't sure if he talked to some one from Russia or not... but to say what  he was doing was some how illegal like a coke deal is ludicrous.  

Talking to people even in other countries about dirt on your political adversary  is called politics.  I get you might not like Trump, but this stuff you are doing is beneath you."
Antifa are the new fascist the irony is off the scales .
"I'm incredibly liberal, social democrat in-fact. But holy crap Antifa has BECOME fascists, they censor everyone that do not agree with them and use violence instead of words. Garbage movement"
Wasn't it said that Saudi Arabia donated to the Clinton Foundation to support Hillary during the election?
"Nazis Shmatzis, pffft. Useful idiots are so brainwashed by these Jewish Zionist liars. Yet, the Jews have indoctrinated people into inverted, woe is jews, reality when it was the jews plan to kill and breed out all white people (Hitler's alleged genocidal plot was really the Jews' plot for white Christians projected onto the Germans!)
 Meanwhile Commie Jews killed and concentration camped like 20 to 135 million nonjews in Soviet Russia. The collective work of Commie Jews has genocided more people than anyone in the 20th century, and they're still doing it today to the Palestinians while orchestrating the flood of Muslim migrants into Europe as a means of destabilization. But, nooooo, only 'Nazis' are evil, because standing up to the Jews' lies,  callous tyranny, and malicious sabotage makes you a terrible person apparently."

FUCK THIS LETS BRING PSY BACK TO NUMBA ONE
Why are they protesting this meeting?
Antifa is straight up a fascist terrorist organization hell bent of destroying free speech.

"This story proves there was no hackers, and the Russian collusion was a nothing burger."
It doesn't surprise me about BLM and Planet of the Apes. If a BLM member walked by a school and saw a banana peel in the garbage they would say the school is racists.
"Let's be honest if you are still turning a blind eye to narcissists and frauds like the Trump family, you should just be ashamed of yourself. It's like being a Tariq Nasheed follower, just blind and dumb."
We all have to go watch Psi Gangnam style.
"What was the point of the story about Planet of the Apes? Was that story literally just picked to make BLM look bad? Because I sure as hell don't believe anyone really cares about the guy's Tweets he later deleted. Goddamn!

Side Note: Defranco dude, tone it down with titles man. If you dont whats up with the titles here is a brief explanation:

I think the big thing for most people now is that with DeFrancoElite, those kinds of titles are not needed anymore since his funding isnt coming from YouTube. It could be a miscommunication/ misunderstanding but i think people thought part of the DeFrancoElite funding was to get rid of the ""clickbait"" titles and be able to talk about whatever the hell he wants to. Obviously there might still be some reasoning behind the titles, but that hasnt been communicated (to my knowledge) and people seem to be getting frustrated with it/ the lack of transparency.

I used to respect Phil for taking both sides. Now most of his news are stories doesn't even matter. The constant whataboutism is really annoying. Im not a hater but wanted to express my thoughts.

Edit: ""FREAKING OUT""- ?? i am in stitches laughing how Phil is saying how overreaching makes a persons real point less powerful etc. whilst at the same time overusing terms like ""freaking out"" and delegitimising when something is actually freak-out worthy."
"If your argument of defense of Don Jr. is ""but Hillary Clinton..."", then you are relying on a nonsequiter. If she did such similar actions, fuck her, try her too. If there's evidence, how can you deny it? These emails are blatant evidence of, at the very least, trying to solicite information from a Russian official. A meeting was clearly set up with a representative of a foreign government with the intent to damage Hillary. That's blatant collusion."
"Who cares how the content was leaked or hacked. The real issue is the corruption within the content. Theirs no getting around the fact that the government has big issues and can't even play nice enough to get anything done. Unfortunately, our government just looks corrupt in general, to the core, and people are losing hope and faith in our system."
Like douchebag father like douchebag son.
"Alternatively, it was all a setup to get more fake news outlets into the limelight. NOTHING happens by accident at those levels"
This is all because stupid human beings are giving stupid celebs too much fucking attention.
Was the guy who was called a nazi an actual nazi?
I'm embarrassed for DeRay. He just compared HIMSELF to an ape......
No secret link ?
"Germans calling a person a nazi, ironic"
Can we just get past all this Russia shit nobody cares it is getting so old can't go one week without bringing it up
Wait! One of those cops in the G20 pic had on a blue vest!!!!!
funny just got back from warped tour it was amazing
I honestly don't think Trump did anything wrong during his campaign. I think everyone around him did so he wouldn't have to though.
"Treason is treason is treason, no matter who. Ok, let's investigate Hillary's campaign, but last I checked, she's not running America right now. Trump's collusion could potentially cripple our economy and erode our constitution for generations. This is seriously dangerous for our country. American citizen's voices have the  potential for being suppressed. Let's stop this partisan divide and agree that all Americans deserve a voice in our country without being selected by a foreign power"
Ask the locals in Germany and they'll say ANTIFA has been at it for decades there.  So much so that the burning of the city block and physical attacks have become the norm there.  You know the NYC mayor was there allegedly organizing the ANTIFA protest.  Do not let them normalize this here.
You are my only source of news.
How are you doing these days? Hope you are have lot of fun! ~ cave man with a computer.
"I'm actually so done with all this political bullshit. No one listens everyone just screams at each other or throws fists. Fuck this. I'ma just go lock myself in my bedroom with some tomato and mushroom soup.
Also if you know what I mean... I love you fam"
"So, Russia told Trump about shady shit Hillary did with Russia.....so, Hillary good, Trump bad?.....Am I missing something here?"
trump jr did not solicit the meeting or the nothing burger the meeting produced.
Black block was there apparently and dressed in their normal black uniforms and causing violence.
"Violence, bullying, and vandalism IS Antifas cause. Any messaging of theirs is just a cover for the self-aggrandizing tyranny."
"I don't think enforcing the law on one party is right.  Why do they want to enforce this law?  I think its fair that if the action is public  who cares they wont be elected.   The goal was to smear campaign someone which is not a crime if factual and if anything was found would have been public.  Someone with a international deal that people support is fine and can be helpful.  

It sounds like politicians are trying convict someone for eating oranges in hotel room, which is a crime in at least one city in the USA."
I say drain the whole swamp. Both sides have done wrong and deserve to be punished. We can't pick and choose who gets to ignore the laws set in place. One of the fastest ways to improve our country is to show all sides that we will no longer put up with corruption and shady practices.
We are watching the collapse of an administration in real time. I expected these things to take longer.
"Did I miss something????

Trump Jr. is gonna get prosecuted for ""trying"" to collude with Russians, yet the entire DNC it's guilty of rigging the primaries to elect Clinton, and NOTHING?!?!

Fuck Democrats. Fuck antifa. Fuck liberals. You're all just bat shit crazy.

And I don't even like Trump. Fuck him too."
Deray is an idiot...enough said.
"As a black man I agree that there is racial inequality in America. That isn't debatable, and I hope that my daughters generation is better than mine. I also think the biggest drug in America at the moment is who can be the biggest victim. EVERYONE is looking to stir up shit to go viral online. Everyone thinks their groups cause is more important than the next. That blue vest shit is weak and really idiotic. There are plenty of good fights to be apart of, but that ain't one of them."
Ugh I'm so sick of trump this trump that but I have to watch every video cuz I'm in love with you Phil
Nonviolent protests literally do not work if it's important.
Antifa seems like a terrorist group who hunts down people who disagree with them politically and they desiccate grave stones and it is so disrespectful
"When I think of preaching peace with fists, which I've done before, I picture a much meaner force (F-A) steps in to tell Force B and C (F-B, F-C) to calm down before it takes them both down. I see that as a responsible use of power, one this nation has used and rely on more times than either of us can count. Same for a singular entity rather than multiple fronts.

You guys want a swamp drained, completely, you can't rely on either party. You have to become the force of change."
Deray mcKUNTSSON + BLM = domestic terrorist Group so put there ass in jail or ship them to Syria with no weapons just air drop there asses and that's it
Phil's word is not gospel. Except in Philip DeFranco's Big Gay Religion! ALL HAIL THE GIANT PURPLE DILDO IN THE SKY!
HIS COMMENT about Charlie Puth being around longer than¬†PSY ¬†is incorrect the average age for Koreans to debut as kpop idols is 18 and if you take that into consideration PSY been around a lot longer. Idk why AmericanS' are saying things like that and even think¬†PSY¬†is a one hit wonder because he's not. He's Korean lives in Korea. is a Korean idols so its not like all his songs are going to be that big to reach America. Its not like he is THE BANGTAN BOYS AKA BTS.¬† THE¬†FIRST ASAIN GROUP TO GO TO BILLBOARD. Take¬† this information and run with it especially since I am an army member
feeling very down after reading the comments XD i know the right isn't all racist or sexist or homophobic or trump supporters but even being associated with all that would make my skin crawl. Is everyone on the left perfect? Nope! Bunch of way too left assholes in this world. but being canadian hearing opinions of many leading republicans on human rights makes me want to vomit. Can someone explain to me what is worth having to put up with all that??
So this video lasts 11:37 and ETC's video on the emails goes 11:37. What's going on here???
"I wouldn't call the shooting of Philando Castille unjust; incredibly dirty with errors on both sides, but not dirty. The officer failed to properly countermand his previous direction for Castille to provide identification, while telling him not to reach for the gun. Castille continued to reach for his wallet, which was possibly near his gun, after being told by the officer not to reach for his gun. There was a communication break down between the to of them."
holy shit it's a movie there is no need to get triggered
Politics in America rn is like a reality TV show that everyone missed a season of and we are all so confused as to wtf is going on üòÇ
"It's a sad day in America when ""Nazism should be opposed violently if necessary lest we have another Holocaust"" is somehow considered a controversial idea."
"Fuck antifa, communist scum."
"Lauren Southern is embarrassing. I don't condone stalking or violence towards her, but, I hope she can learn from this experience. Maybe (but probably not) she can recognize that this is how the people she marginalizes feel when they walk around everyday to the backdrop of her rhetoric. (I saw American History X and The Grinch so I'm optimistic that even neo-nazis can grow a heart.)"
Black Lives Matter mentioned. Gotta comment about how much I give a fuck.
"If having a favorite in the US election and working to help that candidate by swaying public opinion is your standard for foreign manipulation of the election, you need look no further than Canada. Our state broadcaster, the CBC, was clearly biased in favor of Clinton and against Trump. A lot more Americans listen to the CBC than anything out of Russia."
"Psy's throne is taken, this is truly the darkest wordline... OP on my brothers."
nothing can takeaway from the PC video
what is idenitarian?
"Violent leftists have been a big problem in the past Europe, so we have strong reactions from each side towards each other."
Where the fuck is the secret link?
Interesting Phil never mentioned Juniors last response to the email.....that he thought the Russian offer Goldstone proferred was great\ a good idea.....fp

"I think everything is circumstantial.   This guy clearly is off when speaking to the black lives matter movement in this specific situation. But if you are going to write off the entire movement based on one instance, I think that's equally as irrational."
"This is getting absurd. When you begin to think you are more important than you really are...

Tolerance at all violent costs!! How absurd!"
"Phil low key made sure to try and drag the democrats down with Trump, even though there is no comparison between the two alleged wrongdoings."
"Stupid.....Watergate....  ""facedesk"""

Beautiful bastard watsky enthusiasts? Those are my favorite kind of people
Phil. You need to discuss the fucked up shit going on at Watch Cut right now.
"Projection. That first bit is simply just projection.
They see black people as apes, they see an ape, they think black guy, but because they could never be racist because they are such great righteous people, it has to be literally everyone else portraying a black person as an ape... rather than it just being an ape..."

There has to be a significant drop of employment in the US with this many protests the last few months. Either that or all protesters coincidentally have night shifts.
"i just cant understand what antifa's black bloc groups reason for destruction and i HATE that The young turks where defending and ""normalizing"" them. for f*** sake don't normalize them because if you do you make your group look more and more like terrorist"
"I'm sorry Phil but if I see a bunch of communist (yes antifa in general and the black block on G20 are mostly self proclaimed communist and act like that) attacking supposed peaceful  ""nazis/fascists"" I will side against the communist."
Oh look Antifa acting like fascists.

"literally that planet of the apes deray story pissed me off. I'm black and never once thought they were trying to compare black people pr deray himself to apes. Matt Reeves even said that ""Bad Ape"" is the first ape to wear clothes so far to show the progression thier change. he wears it to protect himself from tge cold and gave another jacket to the little girl Nova. thats the end. to claim its a comparison to.him or black people in general demishes the cause he fights for"
"now i see why you have so many followers, you fuckin suck. Yeah, the cause to have black lives matter to police in America is really going to lose credibility because this guy sent a tweet---NOT. The real reason their cause could be derailed by such a comment, however, is by dickhead commentators like you who give some degree of credence to the notion that such a small incident should be given to generalize the movement as a whole, as if their central arguments and grievances are somehow invalid now because of the comment, or somehow could become invalid by the comment. Fuckin dick"
"It's pretty disgusting we don't villainize alt-left groups like we do alt-right groups. Fuck the alt-right, fuck the idea that oppression has any place in our society.

What do you think about the speculation that the meeting also set up a quid pro quo for the information in return for lifting sanctions on Russia especially the Magnisky act. Aren't we already seeing Trump lifting sanctions on Russia even though there seems to be no apparent reason or change from Moscow to warrant lifting of such sanctions (i.e. giving back embassy in U.S. that Obama took away in response to the hacking).
is it just me or was the Sup?! a little extra today?

"Black Lives Matter is a completely horrible movement and should be treated as a hate group. They openly hate whites and police especially, vandalize and riot, and start fires in the middle of highways causing massive disruptions to society. Did you know that a woman's baby almost died because of their immature and retarded highway blockings? She was pregrant and was going into labor and the ambulance had to drive on the wrong side of traffic and spend 20 extra minutes just trying to avoid the massive blockup. This group needs to be dissipated and find other ways to help the police - citizen relationship."

That email's pretty damning I think.
Liberals are as dumb as radical muslims
talk about Watchcut's video. parents explain to kids about masturbation. God it's disgusting.
"Sadly this has not become a left/right issue. it is literally a criminal colluding with active enemies of the nation. followed by likely collusion of the DNC with a non hostile but foreign nation. all in an attempt to win office. What we need is Hillary barred, and Trump, his group and the top tiers of the Republican party, and Democratic members associated with the campaign removed from office. and snap elections held to replace them with people outside the political and affluent sphere."
"Honestly any respect I ever had for BLM is lost, at the very start, it made sense, but now it lost all meaning and is just full of whining and complaining and racist black people."

"So many triggered Trump supporters...

This is scandal exceeds the severity of Watergate by far, and yet you people are ""tired of hearing about it"" or think ""I don't see it is as treason.""

Accepting aid from a foreign country to sway an election is by definition an act of treason.  ""There needs to be a travel ban bc we don't those people undermining America's safety,"" says the people who don't seem to care that our democratic system was undermined.  The same democratic system we swear by when we invade and topple foreign governments and irreparably disfigure the political and diplomatic landscape in those regions.

This apathy from the same lot that thinks statues of confederate soldiers and confederate flags should be prominent on state bureaucratic land.  The confederates were traitors too."
I am not a trump supporter but if you approach a pro trump protest they will talk to you. Not beat you up and Antifa will. They are what's wrong with people. Fucking crying pussies
So Philip want to talk about DNC fraud lawsuit yet.?
Tariq Nasheed is a race baiting tool.
"Thank you Philip for breaking down the important news .. it's the first time of my life that Im interested in politic, and I owe it to the fact that you have a way to explain it that I can understand and stay interested.. thank you"
"I usually like your content Phil but here are my thoughts on your presentation of the G20 Protest.

You say Identitarian as if it is a movement that preaches tolerance and equality, glossing over the need to go in more depth. When in reality the movement has close ties to white nationalism with the Lambda (symbol for Identitarianism) being marched amongst the PEGIDA movement in Munich. (The PEGIDA movement is another far-right, anti-Islam hateful movement who's founder had to resign in 2015 for posing as Hitler and making racist statements on Facebook). At the same time in the USA, Richard B. Spencer, the head of the National Policy Institute (a lobbying group for white supremacy) describes himself as Identitarian and he has called for ""peaceful ethnic cleansing"" in the past.

This is not some peaceful group and wearing Identitarian symbolism (as you put it, I'm not entirely sure what exact shirt she was wearing)  that undoubtedly stands for the bigotry and hatred of the movement is an offense in itself. This being said, the fact that she was wearing hateful symbols does STILL not justify any violence towards her or the people she was with. That's on US to remain peaceful in the face of hatred. 

Regardless, she initiated tension first by wearing what she did and while it's not violent it still warrants her getting some of the responsibility here along with those who chose violence.

What pisses me of here is your blatant misrepresentation of the movement in order to use this to further your narrative of ""liberals, who preach peace, are actually hypocritical and intolerant"".  ""Connecting other people around her to her"", you say this as if it's such a stretch to do that. She connected herself to a hateful movement by wearing the symbolism of said movement. 

Don't mislead people and we both know that you should have offered some context about the Identitarian movement instead of introducing it as some random movement. You did NOT present this story fairly in my opinion."
"who the fuck is deray, and what the fuck is an identitarian?"
Those that look for racism everywhere will find racism everywhere because they see what they want to see
"Phil, what do you think about the Cut Video that was on the trending page about parents teaching their children to masturbate?"
We talk and get outraged and for what?  Nothing will be done about it cause rich people have the power. I'll be shocked if anything actually comes out of it.
I like this guy bc there is no bias here just what is going on and story's from both sides of the argument
Why did you not cover the French president proclaiming himself a god and the New York Times doing a supporting arrival saying a little dictatorship can be good comparing the French president  to napoleon as ww3 is on the verge of erupting. Yes they had the class to compare him to a dictator that caused so much war. At this politically unstable time... Sigh

"Also, re: Lauren Southern, she isn't even close to being a Nazi. She's not a white supremacist or a white nationalist.  This is yet another example of people (Antifa), using their favorite tactic of branding someone they don't like an extremist so they can feel righteous when they attack them.  Yet, as has happened on many past occasions, it merely reveals Antifa/Black Bloc/etc.. for the actual extremists that they are."
"okay, i understand about dont attack people who disagree with you BUT dude, come on. Lets say (to make it simple) Im a Greenbay Fan. I love greenbay. Now i hear theres a Anti-greenbay thing going on and i decide to go.. If i get beat up, then thats my fault. Im around a bunch of people who hate greenbay. I put myself into into that. If a bunny decides to walk threw 57 snakes and the bunny gets eatin, do you blame the snake?? No, the bunny could of went around or went in a different way.. People are putting themselves in these situation KNOWING shit will pop off.. Would a KKK member go to a NWA concert?.. no.."

I don't think he has anything to hide and he is showing it by dumping his emails and essentially docxing himself
"I scrolled for a while and didn't see this in the top comments area, but I can't possibly be the first to notice that Phil read all of the emails between Jr and Goldstone backwards, am I? He read the final email first (June 8) and the first emails last (June 3) -- they are time stamped on the screen clips. Am I crazy or did this actually somehow slip through?! üò±"

"Progressivism  is such a fucking joke. How does anyone support Deray's claim. If you want to be taken seriously and make actual changes, you have to denounce the fanatics and attention seekers in your camp. But I guess the majority of them just go along with this nonsense without question or worse yet, support it."
That these investigations keep going while everyone under Hillary is off the hook is not about partisan politics.  it's about the establishment protecting their own.
the lawyer is sexy as fuck
"I live in TN, a place that's judged to be a stereotypical racist place and I've yet to see black people getting treated poorly, or atleast no worse than I've seen others be treated. Now there are racists, I'm not going to say it doesn't exist here but I've never seen blacks being oppressed anymore than whites"
What up with the shirt is she actually a nazi?
It seems like Trump and the Democrats are trying to one up one another on how awful and idiotic they are.

hey Defranco this was trending on YouTube today. Dude this is just wrong https://youtu.be/-0vPqxSVaG4
"My take away from the Trump, Jr. story is the same opinion I have with the Michael Flynn story: know exactly who you are dealing with, and vet and document everything.  Or, as Ronald Reagan once said, ""Trust, but verify"".  As of now, I believe Trump, Jr.'s assertion that what he did was ""kosher"", but when you dealing with people at such high levels, especially foreign persons and entities, you better know what you are doing, and you better make sure that what you are doing is legal.  Personally, I feel that this Goldstone person was using Trump, Jr. to get to Trump himself, either to later call in a favor, or, most likely, to create an embarrassing situation to profit from.  NONE of these people involved in this story are ""clean"", but, at least for now, I am giving Trump, Jr. the benefit of the doubt because the other people are dirtier.  I hate how politics have become so corrupt over the years, but I am willing to deal with the situation as is.  Why?  Because it's never going to change, and that's sad."
"You say you ""hate nazis"" but that makes it sound like you don't realize what the left is doing. They label ANYONE that disagrees with anything they do as a ""nazi"". It's a stupid term, and if you say that you ""hate nazis"" you might give people the wrong idea, that you support what the radical left does and support them lashing out at people with ideological differences than them."
DUDE! Defranco is going way too easy on Trump and his whole *cough-cohorts*cough...I mean family! :O
I've never even HEARD of whiz whatshisface
Ugh Trump's administration is obnoxious. Why is it even a story about Hillary anymore? She lost the election and is off enjoying her summer. They keep trying to bring her back into the fold when she clearly has washed her hands of it.  Trump Jr is just as corrupt as the rest of them.
Can't take 10 seconds to mention the KC-130 crash killing 16 Marines? Not newsy enough for you?
Phil. He misspoke. but your hurting the general message that Deray wants the world to know. He works tirelessly for this issue and it can take over a persons mind. Shame that you made this news so BLM can look worse. He probably feels guilty bc he knows this could bring negative light to a message of knowledge. Share that!
"Completely agree Phil, someone should hold folks accountable for the stuff they do. Ironically, the people that would be held accountable, are the one's who should hold people accountable."
"phil...



does your arms and hands ever hurt?"
"I despise anti-fa, for being anti-fascist they are the only ones with nazi tendencies."
"What Trump Jr did was basic opposition research. At the same time Jr was meeting with this lawyer (Who works in DC, she's a registered FARA agent), Clinton had a man, employed through a research firm, named Christopher Steele physically in Russia. Steele was talking to high ranking (Per the report he made) Russian intelligence officials (Literal spies) as well as ministers in the government, trying to 'work with them' to get intelligence on Trump. The report was the infamous ""Steele"" Dossier Buzzfeed published.

So Clinton had people literally in Russia soliciting spies for information on Trump. Why? Because this is normal. It's normal opposition research. There is NOTHING illegal about this. If you ask why Trump Jr didn't reveal it before now, it's because the political atmosphere about Russia has been charged to hell, and there is no reason to release your oppo research. (Any good organization has hundreds of failed leads through FARA agents per campaign). 

This is another case of the media taking something completely normal, and twisting it to sound bad. No laws were broken, at all. (Before anyone says campaign finance. First, of value is a specific term--they would have to prove this data required money to collect. Seconds, violating that is a civil offense, its a fine--not criminal.)"
"This concerning the G20 protests. 
Let me state without any doubt, violence is not the answer! Let me repeat this, violence is not the answer! nor do I condone any violence!
     Having stated that, I've been a press photographer on and off for over 33 years. Covering various street stories. And in that time I have found that when emotions boil over, people want to lash out and attack. And they usually want to attack the ""man"".
     Now, for the focal point of those attacks. There are usually two primary one secondary choice. First choice, the police. But they have all the guns sticks and other weapons. The next choice, is the press. The press has no sticks guns or weapons. Making the press a much better and juicier target. Pluses they get walloped on the film at all, and then that film will get shown on TV and YouTube and all sorts of social media. Which will get their message heard and maximum coverage. The secondary choice, is each other. That often occurs as well. But does not garnishes much coverage as say attacking the press.
     My definition of the press is very loose, both the general Constitution and legal definition is basically anyone recording history. Recording the what happened, and then putting that out for the world to see. This can be done in several mediums, such as newspaper, various social media, and places like YouTube or Snapchat.
     I do realize that I've just defined everybody with the cell phone as a potential press person. That was not accidental. It is very much the case. Also realize, the larger the rig your caring makes you a larger target. If you get a chance to look at the video of some of the mainstream press you might notice there are security personnel around the reporter and the cameramen. These are usually hired by the company to protect their interests. As a low level photographer or press person, we must look out for each other. Former defensive barrier when you see one gain isolated by the group, by the mob. And look out for each other even if there your direct competition. For the next time it may be you who needs that protection.
     Just my two cents worth."
"WOW Philip...!
I thought it was JUST the USA that was loosing it's MIND... NOW I see Europe is following suit...!

"The German thugs that call themselves antifascist are just thugs and nothing more.  They are violently preventing others from exercising their rights.  What they claim about their motives doesn't really matter and should not be believed.

On the Russian emails, the biggest issue is that the meeting actually happened.  They communicated among themselves to arrange to attend a meeting they believed was for an illegal purpose.  What ended up being discussed doesn't matter.  They took action in furtherance of the intended crime.  That is enough for a conspiracy charge."
"They ARE Nazis. LOL. All these apologists when you know exactly what ""identitarian"" are. While I don't agree with Antifa harassment, these ""identitarians"" are cancer. And Germany has a pretty good reason why they don't want it to rise again."
"Generally when people don't have an argument, or can not back up their ideals it just makes them angry and they result to insults or physical attacks.... this is continually showcased on this channel. Makes me sad."
"Oh boy look at all the angry libtard sjw's, and inbred Trumpanzees going at it. It's a shame that neither side has cracked a history book to realize they are both falling for the oldest trick in said book. 

Apparently the homeland security act wasn't a big enough red flag. It's called divide and conquer. If the retards are busy fighting amongst themselves they won't notice their freedom being eroded away until they have none left. 

It's a shame that it will be our children and grandchildren that will have to bleed and die to get back the freedoms that we pissed away.
You guys do realize the NSA has databases on all of us right? Why do you think that is? To keep you safe? The moderates will be, but the extreme left, and extreme right will be sent to one of the hundreds empty FEMA camps for ""reeducation"" to the thunderous applause of the masses.

"As someone affiliated with Antifa i will say this in our defense. as a non centralized group with no centralized Ideology different sub groups handle things far differently. some are non violent, some are reactionarily militant, and some are just looking for a fight. since its not a centralized group theres no widespread consensus on how to do things. some are dicks, some are not."

"G20 happened at Toronto once, I was in the bathroom and one walked in and I smashed his head on the floor until it was all bloody and stole his phone and money. I have not been contacted by police so I can only assume they said fuck this guy and didn't even investigate it. I hope that guy is now handicap for the rest of his life."
I was lied to.... no secret link of the day
Philly D WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? Attacking people makes antifa SEEM intolerant and violent? Have you never heard of antifa? That's like saying ISIS is dumb for killing people cause it makes their cause look bad. Their cause INCLUDES KILLING PEOPLE. And antifas cause INCLUDES ATTACKING PEOPLE.
"Phil, inb4 actually watching this. I feel like using the same phrasing in your titles as much as you do (people are freaking out) is sort of a detriment. You pop up in my recs all the time but because of your uniform thumbnails the repeated use of the same phrase makes me skim past because I think it's an old one. Clicky titles are good ofc, but it might be an idea to branch out in terms of actual phrasing to differentiate them."

"Considering the Planet of the Apes series has, since the beginning, been a commentary about racism and the mistreatment of animals, this dumbass coming in and being like ""Planet of the Apes is racist because people used to use monkeys as a racial stereotype of black people"" is fucking stupid. The series' whole point is to show what mistreatment and discrimination lead to: an inevitable ""war"" and it only ends in mutually assured destruction or one side being marked a ""winner,"" with the loser being under their foot until the cycle repeats itself again until they either wise up to the problem, or utterly destroy one another. The apes are the allegory for oppressed groups, and the real world mistreatment of animals in captivity.

Take for instance the classic line ""Get your stinkin' paws off me, you damn, dirty ape!"" from the original movie, for instance. That line's sole purpose is to show that the discrimination is self-sustaining, and by tilting power away from one group to the other, you're just doing what you accused the other side of doing because people (and apes, in this case) petty and want revenge for years of mistreatment and oppression. Shit doesn't work like that. The final shot of the original movie, with the whole ""You maniacs! You blew up! Damn You! Damn you all to hell!"" is the main character realizing that mankind brought the current state of things (the apes ruling, and the humans being pets/slaves to the apes) upon themselves because of how they mistreated the apes before they rose above them and into power.

This film is basically on their side, though they're being too blinded by their agenda to make everything seem racist to see that the Apes series has been telling people of the errors in oppressive power structures."
"But Phil, antifa and their buddies ARE intolerant. They are not hurting their cause because violence, hatred, and ignorance IS their cause."
Germans calling Americans Nazis. Don't get me wrong - I hate facism - but I can appriciate the historical irony here.

"i dont see how information is considered a contribution or donation. in business law a contribution refers to an amount of money or assets. when did information become a donation? ive tried giving information instead of money, nobody will take it. still, yes, DTjr probably should have told someone but seriously, who could you tell. you going to call the department of justice, the department that had hillary clintons back thru the election. and tell them what exactly? i like how phil doesnt comment too much on things he doesnt have all the info about but it seems to when it comes to trump, he is more than willing to throw his Opinion into the mix about what is going on or how to interpret the law. hypocrites are not consistent on the views the they hold. again, i want someone to tell me where the crime is. someone contacts you with dirt on someone, they have no information, obviously nothing came of it or else the trump campaign would have said something after. does it not seem funny that obama knew russia was interfering with our election and did nothing. doesnt it seem funny that someone actually had dealings with the russians about uranium, made money, was careless with classified info, ran for president and was investigated but wasnt charged for lack of intent? when officials of the administration were asked, they said that they thought hillary was going to win anyways, so it wasnt a priority. the mass ignorance is troubling. people dont see what is really going in front of them. and then you have fucktards like PhillyD furthering the ignorance by throwing in irrelevant facts before he asks you to think about it, ie. philando castille= felt the need to tell people the race of the jurors after making comments referring to racism.  its never going to stop as long as you have people trying to make race an issue. sometimes it is and sometimes it isnt but trying to make racism appear for views, is just sick. you were once a good channel to go to find out what was going on but i think the money has gotten to your head. which is understandable, you have increased what you use on a daily basis, be it cars, electronics, employees, rents, etc but when you cause unintentional anger between people just so you can maintain your preferred level of comfort, just makes you part of the problem and more pathetic than anything. i will still hold out some hope for you by hoping that some of the shit you say is just because you have a diverse squad of douches that that seem to be independents to closet alt lefts and being that you dont seem to do all your own research anymore and delegate it out, i hold on to hope that you let a liberal millennials write your monologues. lastly i just want to ask commenters, do the people who fuel this social divide for money think that when the shit hits the fan, it doesnt reach their front door? seriously, i just want to know what they think money will be able to buy when the economy starts to crumble due to a modern civil war."

there's more to the DTJ story. There's a reason why Russia stopped America Adoptions.  There are top Russian officials who have sanctions against them. Hillary supposedly had a deal to with Putin to stop all this. That is what was talked about in the DTJ meeting.

You to create a scandal out of nothing 101. First hire a company to dig dirt on your opponent. 2 Have a Russian lawyer associated with that company lure the son of your opposing candidate to meet with her because she has criminal evidence of you. 3 when they meet have the Russian claim that she never had information about yourself and claim to media that the son just want any scandal info he could get to undermine you. Step 4 have the media push a conspiracy with the Russian government so that the American people will be suspicious of treason. Step 5 let this distract from all the illegal things you and your party did in the election to give you the best possible chance of becoming president.

IN YOU EYES WE ALL ""BEAUTIFUL BASTARDS"", BUT RACISM STILL EXISTS AND IT IS A PAINFUL REMINDER WHEN WE SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND RACIST PEOPLE KNOW THAT THIS WILL CAUSE SUCH A KNEE-JERK REACTION JUST SO THEY CAN SAY THAT BLACK PEOPLE AND OTHER RACES ARE INFERIOR TO THEM.

What exactly are they uprising against? Their predominantly black police force? Their predominantly black city government, all of which are democrats? The government for which the last eight years was run by a black person?

Great video. I did watch this while pooping though.

Yikes all these stupid conservatives in the comments
"Yeah, major parts of the Antifa are actually pretty fascist themselves. They are left-wing extremists. However, you have to consider that the identitarian movement is by definition right-wing nationalistic, so they are fascist as well and one step away from being nazis. Showing up at a protest that has left wing extremists wearing something like that is provocative and can lead to pretty heated up situations. It's not as if the YouTubers you mentioned were unaware of this. Of course violence is always inexcusable, but they were obviously trying to stir shit up."
God forbid anyone with any percentage of Russian heritage talks to anyone in the Trump cabinet or family. Or dine at their restaurant. Or think about Donald Trump in their sleep. That might mean Trump is colluding with Vladimir Putin.
why do people think Lauren is a Nazi? I don't really know much about her
OK you may have redeemed yourself Phil. I was very shocked when I saw yesterdays show where you downplayed the Trump Jr./Russia scandal. You do still feel a little too right wing as opposed to being balanced which you claim - which I agree must be hard.
"So cops can setup traps for car theft and men looking to hookup with underage kids, technically it's the same thing? someone please explain how is that any different than what Trump jr did?"

seeing watsky at warped tour was lit asf!
"Yea, that's a great point. People keep talking about how Hillary has done all of these illegal things and would rather ""talk about it"" than prosecute her.
Trump supporters been chanting lock her up for a full year and as soon as Trump says ""we'll let her off the hook"", it's gone. That's it? If you really think she is corrupt, then you should be protesting Trump to lock her up by investigating the accusations her. 
The fact that Trump isn't investigating her might just prove half of those accusations are just BS."
What Don JR did was pretty immoral and in bad judgement but itd be a stretch to call it illegal and its far from the gotcha that CNN and the left has been looking for

"Found out about Watsky through Table Talk back in the day! I got to see him in Northampton, Mass. a couple years ago, where he took 15 minutes past the meet and greet to talk baseball history (he wore a Brooklyn Dodgers hat, had to talk about). Still one of the nicest & greatest talents out there!"
"we are all apes weather your white black asian spanish idian, thats what we are"
Why bring up drain the swamp? Trump said he was going to do it and then flooded the swamp. If you think he was ever going to do other or is still going to drain the swamp then you must be ignorant.
And we have confirmation that blacks keeps racism alive!!
Holy shit that's my boy!
"That should be a T-Shirt ""Don't preach tolerance with your fist!"" With a picture of an easily licensed kungfu guy"
What's up with all these Germans calling people Nazis?
I'd jump on Lauren Southern
"I hope every single person being aggressive to people simply taking video, get identified and have the same done to them to see how they like it.   I bet they start crying about it."
No secret link? :(
you cant fix stupid
"That was a very enthusiastic ""SUP, YOU BEAUTIFUL BASTARDS"""
"I wouldn't call those ""protesters"" protesters, they're breaking the law and destroy in property etc... They're rioters."
It seems to be a super secret link of the day
I tending to think everything @tariqnasheed says is just the SJW version of trolling.
"""I'm a wittle girl who acts like a wittle boy and I'm a killer with my wittle sword"" lol."
"I hated Psy, but I laughed my ass off when he read mean tweets and someone said they should shove a stick up his ass so he can't dance, and he said ""You can but I can still dance""."
"Phil, please solve that Rubik's cube in the background. It's been bothering me for some time."
"Whoa... Did you kinda-quote Hadise's ""Creep""? I'm sure there are a number of songs that have the lyric similar to the line ""This song is not about you"", but it caught my attention right away. It's one of my favorite songs. :D"
"Can't see the secret link, RIOT"
no secret link??? I was told secret link yet none to be found...
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è They all need to be investigated and charged. No one is above the law!
#ShutUpTariq
Lets just all be Conservatarians.... Screw the people who are JUST liberals and JUST conservative. Those are the extremist.
Anyone know the name of those lamps in the back?
I can't deal with how you say antifa
There's no secret link...
"3D chess. Bribe Hillary financially  to discredit her, hack the poles to make Trump win than gradually put the pieces into play to completely destroy the credibility of the entire country"
"I don't get how shoving someone to the ground, and sucker punching them with a group of your mates any time they so much as try to stand up, let alone DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM ASSAULT from you makes THEM the Nazis, but sure. Fine. Just keep lying through your teeth."
"Ssssooooooo the ONLY time you decide to bring up Philando Castile is when there's something negative to say ü§î interesting. Where was your ""opinion"" when the ppl were fighting for justice or when the cop got off on the chargesüòí"
"""What difference does it make"" - Hillary Clinton"
Phil are you going to cover LeafyIsHere and what happened today at some point?
"This whole ape thing is BS
Clam down it's a movie about apes not everything is a hate speech towards you"
"Planet of the Apes is racist against black people.  I might have a concussion from how hard my head just hit my desk.  If apes are secretly intelligent now and watching youtube, please just conquer the human race for real.  We're done."
"I personally don't think you covered the G20 protest as well as you usually do. You picked a few specific targeted actions rather than focusing on the broader stupidity, that happened that weekend. These people, destroying the streets and burning down cars didn't have any political motives. The only purpose was destruction, and that's not what the protests were about! I am from Hamburg myself and I don't think other countries really get how disappointed we are in these stupid individuals.
Maybe you could have also mentioned, that there was a collective cleaning on sunday, where we gathered around the destroyed places and helped everywhere we could! 
For me, those are the real heroes and deserve to be recognized!"
"TIL talking to some Russian Lawyer with no ties to the government is ""Collusion"" and ""Treason"". Goddamn its Obama's a secret Muslim all over again."
Where's the secret link?!
This only shows the large hidden agenda that both candidates have.
Phil I'm not seein the secret link. I don't think it's there.
What's a idinatarian?
its  obvious that the other thing of value means something that is not cash but is worth money.
They were tweeting out her location as she was trying to get away @Philip DeFranco
"TYT already said they're sorry for the terrorist causing trouble at the G20 .
The police should have gone full Blitzkrieg on their asses and dealt with them. Maybe with a Panzer division or 2 for support."
"People are still mad about wikileaks effecting hillarys election , its so stupid.
Wherever the information came from its true, and you should be happy someone informed you.
Its like getting made at the person who tells you your gf is a cheating whore, instead of being mad at your girlfriend.
""Other countries shouldnt be involved though in our elections "" tell that to "" iv recieved 30 million from saudi arabia for my campaign"" clinton."
the vest thing reminds me of the strikeout/kkk thing the world didn't start after you were woke. do your homework b4 u lead ppl.
"When is Hillary going to prison??!! Hillary, don't drop the soap!"
Antifa members need to bite a bullet. It's the only cure that seems viable anymore.
"As mixed as I am on Heavy, I still don't agree that that was cool."
"for some reason the switch from ""southern"" to ""announcer"" accents at the start of every episode really bothers me"
wish there was more of an effort to bridge the divide in the country instead of people with audiences calling out people as suspected white supremacists.
Fake News 9:27
"Hurry the fuck up, polizei. Gun down the fucking protesters already."
All liberals will die one day for the injustice they do and turn people against them. U want violence motherfuckers?!?
"Where is the secret link?!?!? I feel cheated Phil!!! Nah, I love your face! Keep up the good work Phil!"
"I don't know Phil it is also very stupid to wear a fascistoid or identitarian shirt in a place were there are most certainly far left people, you have to take into account that this was in Germany a place that lived through a fascist and identitarian regime, so I kinda disagree here"
Damn Antifa screwing up
"People can't compare antifa to all liberals, they're anarchists. You can identify as liberal and not be fucking batshit insane. Antifa is all about the idea that if you aren't with them completely, you're against them, and they'll come at you for that. I photograph protests in Boston and if I even talk to one of the right wing protestors, they immediately turn on me and will physically shove me out of the way. Meanwhile, my persona basically screams liberal, I smell like weed and I'm wearing gay pride shit, they don't care who you are. To them, If you aren't Antifa you're the enemy. Doesn't matter if you're liberal or conservative. In their minds they think the only successful way to change others is through violence. It's disappointing, especially for other activists who want to make change through peaceful protests, their actions cause everyone to demonize all protestors. I've seen antifa attack innocent people who are holding signs that their ideology is supposed to agree with. Shits obnoxious. I'm just lucky I'm in Boston, at least Boston Antifa isn't stupid enough to start a riot. Boston PD is jacked ever since the marathon bombing."
"wow, u have a agenda now. da fox news o show!"
"""My opinion is not Gospel""
This is what makes me respect Phil so much more than other news sources! This also makes me happy to be a part of a community that can have a reasonable conversation. Keep doing what you are doing!!!"
this is the first time your coming to realize Antifa is filled with violent communists Phil? c'mon
so glad you are doing some commentary with substance now...keep it up !
"If you assault a ""Nazi"" because of them using their free-speech and expression, doesn't that kind of make you seem like the Nazi??"
"Im Scandinavian and Celtic (meaning Irish and Swedish heritage). The Minnesota Vikings and Boston Celtics are making a mockery of my ancestry

Maybe not the same as the blue vest thing, but its just as silly."
Didn't Charlie Puth make an intro or outro? for Phil a long time ago?
"Didn't Charlie Puth create a theme song for the Philip DeFranco show waaayyy back in the day? He also used to have an afro! I knew I wasn't crazy when I recognized him from somewhere, but his old videos circa 2009 all seem to be gone."
Is nobody going to talk about how the New York Times had Don Jr.'s email chain and was prepared to publish them? I find it hard to believe that Don Jr. or those around him leaked them to the organization so what gives them the legal right to publish illegally compromised personal data?
"The left does not ""seem"" intolerant and violent.  The left IS intolerant and violent."
"just asking but are you basically saying that musicians who post music videos only aren't youtubers because they only post music videos or did you mean someone who started out on youtube which is also asking the question, what Is your definition of a youtuber"
"I wonder, has anyone had a thought that Russian hacking was made deliberately more ""traceable"" than usual to undermine stability in US?"
Wait they say that other thing of value would be a twisting of the language? Information can be very very valuable depending on what that information is.
How is Planet Of The Apes racist? It's something that you call a fucking movie and if you can't tell the difference between entertainment and reality then you are painfully retarded!
Thank you for the news Philly D
Liberals always use violence. FUCKEM ALL
What is the definition of Identitarion here?
The anti-nazis appear to be worse than nazi's now - kind of impressive that they've managed that.
Not sure if Phil mispronounced Dee-Ray as Der-ray on purpose to highlight his durr moment... but if the shoe fits...
"Phillip once again not knowing what he talks about -.- this was the ""black block"" people who are extremists and terrorists. For them if you stand next to a conservative you are also one. They hate the us for their wars and other bullshit ""reasons"". For them it was a success that all the bad stuff happens. As a German you could easily tell those groups apart. The black block are people who came to Hamburg to destroy things they have nothing in common with the protesters. Please dont just pull 2 news articles from the web and sell it as ""news"" get better ""researchers"" or just speak to someone who was there. Kinda disappointed :-/"
You forgot the secret link of the day
Sounded like there was some extra umph in the bastards intro this time :)
can you talk about the Marines and how they have started artillery shelling of isis and how awesome it is
"""Don't preach tolerance with your fists"" (Philip De Franco, 2017)"
"10:28 So hold up because I'm confused, if that law is your main argument to go against Trump Jr., which is perfectly reasonable, then what about the donations that the Clinton foundation got from countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, etc...

I know that her foundation is not the DNC, but it's being held by the Clintons, the money goes to them and curiously enough, the donating countries got arms dealerships with the US

I'm not saying that it's the same thing, I'd just like to know what the difference is between the two cases because clearly there's a correlation and something in common in both the story and the thing I just brought up, and why we are trying to prosecute one but not the other"
"Dude, apes's motif is us Japanese not black people. Don't freak out. We're chill..."
Donald Jr. has a button chin lol
I've accepted that Donald Trump will have his 4 years but I just still don't understand why people defend his Muslim ban shit.
Where's the secret link? Or is it actually secret
"You know what, Phil? I'm a Trump guy, still think he's a good choice, but your line ""We TRIED to collude but we couldn't figure it out!"" had me laughing for days. Hilarious."
Ahh Emails a politician's kryptonite.
saying The Warped Tour is just like saying The Facebook lmao Phil you so cute
I don't like this guy's channel.. he talks too much like a woman.
"About the Donald Trump Jr thing and Russia I say..Who , besides the Democrats really cares anymore..They have become such a joke , they have no policies no direction , hell they can't even tell us who their leader is.There's even rumblings that Hillary Clinton might run again. That's why Trump will win the next election , if only congress could get their shit together about health care."
Phil you need to talk about this disgusting video on trending https://youtu.be/-0vPqxSVaG4
Trump Jr's chin looks like an anus...
When he talked about them colluding he sounded like Jerry Seinfeld
filando castile  shooting was not unjust. it is a false  naritive that is being pueher my blm
Because...because it incriminates the two of them?
"With regards to ""other things of value"", I would say that information does hold a monetary value, since like many things it can be sold in an open market for an agreed upon price.  Hence a foreign country offering to give information to a campaign in the US would definitely fall under that clause."
G
Some violent protesters? Lmao there were THOUSANDS of antifa/black block there.
"When ""protesters"" go around smashing up and looting random small businesses and setting other people's cars on fire, why not call them what they really are?"
"WHY in the world..do African Americans always complain on how they are always the victim.  Their are other cultures who have it worse.  Yet, they seem to feel they are the ones always suffering.  I never hear oh this street gang killed people on the news. But if one cop does wrong.  They attack everyone.  This is why I am glad as an American, I no longer live in the country.  Get your shit together already."
"Communists, Post-Modernists, Marxists and Socialists are Fascists, Fascism is a Far-Left Ideologue."
Trump Jr. is brown af
Muh blue vest!
"No secret link Philip. Why do you lie to us Phil? Why do you lie Phi? Did we hurt you in some way Fill? Im sorry, please File don't hate us we won't do it again."
"You will go to jail if you conspire to murder, attempt to rob a bank, try to break into a house. Even though any of those things never actually got done it's still as bad as actually doing it. I tried to explain this to Trumps supporting audience and they still don't get it. Lame."
See this is why people think you're an Trump backer you take this clear Trump Jr's Email Dump and spin around and make it about the DNC. Im sure if you read this comment on your show you'll just blow me off and say i have bad grammar or something. but its really hard for me to support you when you do everything to can to normalize trump. its kinda fucked up man.
"If Trump Jr woulda just bleached, destroyed, and lied... this would be okay and a non-story. Right?"
"How long can Republicans continue to support this ILLEGITIMATE administration? Oh wait, they're the scum of the earth, so they will never stop"
Identitarians?
"I feel like the BLM movement is right that black people get targeted by police, but can we look at the facts that the US population is %12 Africa American but %37 of jail inmates are Black, in my opinion this is unfortunate and it reminds us that the world is unfair, and that a few people can ruin it for everyone"
"blm is getting hilarious. they're dumb, thinking that their failure is because of white men and cops, they know they failed at their life that is why they made blm to keep their mentally ill brain busy."
Dump the Trump
"Everybody is saying that there is a ton of racist comments, but I only see people talking about them.  Where they at doe?"
can you talk about the disgusting video watchcut uploaded about parents teaching their kids about masturbation? it's so disgusting and it's on trending.
"7:50 Phil I love ya, but sometimes the false equivalency bothers me. ""Some see this as a lie"" IT IS A LIE. 
Some things aren't a matter of ""he-said-she-said let's just call it even"". Facts matter"
Tolerance or I'll beat that shit into you! ~ 2017
"I think the black lives matter is a great movement that is trying to end injustice. However, the so called leaders are just shills who only want to further their own career. Deray is a showboat that uses BLM to make himself relevant he and Killer Mike are just like the Kardashians. But, they are worst because they are so called protectors that only shout and scream foul play to get attention and not to really help people. You can just see in this comment section on what kind of damage he has done."
"If you look at a monkey in a vest and the first thought in your head is ""black people!"" then that says a hell of a lot more about you then anything else."
It's annoying when germans call American Nazi's. Oh the irony.
"""my opinion is not gospel"" 
YES PHIL
claps and raises arms"
"Fuck you Phil, Psy is still the king"
"Yes your President is indeed a whirlwind of somewhat fresh air. Would your President authorize his Son in Law to do this. I do not think so. The naivety of this entire process just baffles me. The left certainly want to destroy your President. However, virtually all of the media at work in your country are Left leaning. The Democrats in both houses are certainly dragging their feet wherever they can. The forgotten masses of US citizens who voted in their desire to change the status quo. They will remember all this crap in the Fall elections."
When you drain the swamp what you are find is the scariest swamp monsters that only were myth before. The swampiest of swamp monsters the biggest alligators etc. now what do you do with the swamp creatures you find? You give them positions in the presidential cabinet.

Those protests were full of fucking territost stop fucking sympathizing for them. They want communism and socializm Philip. Wtf is this pandering shit
"Phil you forgot BLM 101: everything is about them, even when it's not. That of course includes Planet of the Apes. They are offended by it, so now no one is allowed to enjoy it."
"So let me get this straight...
All this talk about Russia collusion over the last months comes down to a meeting where they talked about how corrupt Hillary is with Russian people? And it wasnt even Trump himself? Also i dont get it? A russian gov lawyer wants to sell Russian ties to anti establishment candidate? Why would Russian government give their assets for free to trump?¬† I mean they colluded with Secretary of State Hillary who will be (according to all media) the next president. Why give info on her for free? Why not use it to black mail her or continue to collude as to now? The story seems fake from A to Z And if Russians had no info on Hillary, why setup such a meeting? The first obvious answer is to use Trumps greed, lure him into a meeting and make a story out of it... Just a little thinking. I can bet money its bullshit and nothing will come out of it.
its really a nothingburger"

"I hate when protesters are doing the opposite of their message, reminds me about the Futurama episode where Bender said: ""We must spread our peaceful ways, BY FORCE!"", and then protesters get injured by the police and yell ""Police brutality!"" Personally I think that the protesting is getting in the way of peace and communication of the g20, and is useless."
"Philip, where is the secret link  !?!

British Columbia is getting hit hard with fire.  Multiple towns evacuated.
"D Trump jr is not a politician. I too talk to Russians. Is that a problem?

God I hate see you again. And it beat out Gangnam style. Sad.
"obviously the Russian government is going to support the candidate who doesn't hate them. But there still isn't any hard evidence that they influenced the election in anyway, even if they wanted to"
"As an African American, I do realize that the BLM movement is flawed. BLM needs to work on our own community and stop the killing of ourselves One thing I truly hate seeing whenever a BLM story comes out is BLM is the same as the KKK. BLM is a movement to stop murder by the police. The KKK is a white terrorist group who in the past beat and lynched African American people. BLM is supposed to be a peaceful movement with a cause. People really need to stop comparing the two because BLM has not murdered anybody of any other race and is henceforth NOT the same thing as the KKK."
Gonna go watch Psy again...

The problem with these black lives matter supporter is because they want and they love being victimized even when there aren't. The fact that they thought the blue vest was a reference to that guy is proof that they're mentally weak and really are slaves to their fears.
If anyone would actually be willing to support their beliefs without fighting and being open minded and willing so much would be easier. Why can't we all agree that we LIVE IN A COMMON REALITY?
Thanks Phil!
Fuck BLM they just do not want to lose their Dindu arguments that are slipping away from them. Last of the lazy.

"Hey Phil. So on the same day we had antifa protesting on our city green, we had voter registration in black church communities organized by some white dude. This is clearly the work of the democratic party. They were busy this weekend."
Phil during the 60's  .. You dont have to sit at the lunch counter and demand to be served.. your hurting your own cause
LAUREN!!!!!!
"telling people to be peaceful in the face of oppressors is ridiculous. all movements occurred from rioting and protesting. stonewall had bricks thrown. if hugging douche bags helped the oppressed, we'd have equality by now.

"I'm sorry Phil but your claim of parity when it comes to ""draining the swamp"" just doesn't fly. Hillary's swamp isn't running the country so in no way is nearly as relevant. You seem to bend over backwards to appear impartial, but much of your bending is in Trumps direction. I understand they (Trump supporters) are much more likely to organize campaigns to thumb down your video, or make hateful comments, but sometimes you just have to grow some balls, and take the heat for calling it like it is."
what about the Australian reporters savage viral trump deconstruction of g20
In my mind the effects of Russian hacking in the election are overblown by MSM. It was only one of many factors in the outcome of the election. It is sometimes hard to discern what is a big deal and what isn't from MSM. They seem more concerned with trashing Trump than reporting the news.
Derey is an idiot. All lives matter.
"I think that fucking idiot talking about the planet of the apes is a fucking moron, all he is doing is calling black people him self apes!! Indirectly of course but think about it, he brought it up for no fucking reason!! No ones was saying that before him!! Like wtf man!!"
funny how germans call other people nazis like they would have no connection to them XD
"Blacks, Lives Matter."
"As a former intelligence officer, in the USAF. Lets just say, for the sake of argument, the Donald Jr. meeting with the Russian attorney, was a big nothing burger. It doesn't matter. This is how Russia works to influence, and blackmail. One example they gave us is...you meet a Russian for lunch. That person hands you a piece of paper, that says ""Happy Birthday"". Another operative takes a photo. Next day, that Russian person shows you the photo, and says: ""I will show this your people, that you were passing classified information in this photo...IF...you don't provide me real classified information. This is why,  in politics, military, and military contractors, you REPORT EVERY DAMN ENCOUNTER with a Russian. But you see...NONE...not Mr Bone Spur, or Bone Spur Jr., ever served their country. They would not know...and that puts US ALL AT RISK. TRUMP NEEDS TO BE IMPEACHED."
"Lauren southern is the real mvp, also Antifa are actually a fascist movement and they don't even know it, it's glorious."
"but I also think that it can be just as dangerous to make the assumption that because he doesn't own blue puffy vest does not mean that it was not a comment about him.  I do agree that it was probably not about him but anyone with a brain would also understand that that would be the way that most people would see it meaning that people would most likely say that ""what, that is ridiculous, he doesn't own blue vest"" I have known of situations where a person was framed for something that they did not commit but knew that people would not believe that he did not do it because why would someone go out of their way to frame you?  what makes you so special?  why would someone do something so conspiratorial against you while the actual actor knew that no one would believe that the more he protested."
"Notice how people who hate Nazis above all reason are now acting like.......the Nazis did with the Jews! But it's OK right? After all they are whats wrong with society & need to be stopped from doing any more damage & spreading their web of influence to our youth!

Wait. Filming started October '15. You're telling me they took over 18 months to put a vest joke in the movie? God damn it must be hard being that full of yourself.
"Phil, it is now leaking that the fake Russian Lawyer now has ties to Fusion GPS. Why is this proof this is now a set up? Fusion GPS was paid by $200,000 by the DNC and Clinton for work Fusion GPS did for them in the summer of 2016. , and The DNC and Clinton paid $200,000 for fake news of Trump, hookers, and pissing. It is all turned out to be lies, and these lies were used by Obama and Comey for wiretaps. They have now published photos of this Fake Lawyer sitting right behind the Obama ambassador to Russia just 8 days after the so called Trump meetings. How does one get front row seats to Congressional hearings? The left wing media forgets or just ignores the fact cash was exchanged for ""evidence"" so does this not fall under your idea that laws were broken? Trump got nothing and ended the meeting early, he published the e-mails. Clinton, the DNC have never released any dealings with the Chris Steele documents. This is a failed set up by the DNC and smells of Susan Rice handy work run out of Obama's home in DC."
too bad everyone is creaming over a legal meeting....of someone who didn't work for the Russians at the time??
"I think the problem with the G20 protests was, that in Germany and worldwide extremist leftist groups are not being prosecuted as much as extremist right wing groups. Of course, in history extremists on the right have done extremely bad things, but that is because they were extremists. Left wing extremism is as bad as any other form of extremism, and in fact a danger to society. Violence is never a way to solve a problem, only it can only create further problems."
"I just want to say that when referring to the Philando Castile shooting you used the word unjust. From the footage shown, in my opinion it was a completely reasonable action taken by that officer. I don't know if you are referring to how it could've been handled better and how it wasn't right that a man lost his life. But using the term unjust for the officers action doesn't seem like the right word."
"Omg, when Phil used the 'Coke Deal' example, I was actually picturing a Coca-Cola deal, and instead of Coca-Cola, they were going to try to sell you Pepsi."

I do agree that when you over extend and say dumb things it can twist how others perceive you. I also think we need to take into account if they do this a lot or made a mistake and realized it and tried to make it right. idk if it's the case here but everyone does or says stupid things.
Phil I totally agree about the G20 protests.
"I disagree with 100% of things that Lauren Southern says and I especially dislike that she tends to ignore facts she doesn't like, but it's disgusting that people would physically attack her for her beliefs. She's non-violent and doesn't encourage any kind of violence or real discrimination. And then to target the people who are with her, and I guarantee most of the people who went after her group had no clue who the people with her even were. That's just disgusting."
Very much agree with your point about overextending re: Planet of the Apes
Phill you sounded like you said they were wrong for attacking the people around lauren but not lauren  ?
Falando ..?
Everyone let's go watch Gangam style 100 million more times
Holy fuck are you fucking kidding me. ITS FUCKING PLANET OF THE APES ITS A GOD DAMN MOVIE SHUT THE FUCK UP. That guy is self sentenced idiot and the white knight bull shit in our country where everything is racist is starting to piss me off
I think you're a racist Phil. But I still love your show because you always say it's just your opinion. Well that is mine
people like that make black people look like bitches
"I think the whole plan was to use Trump as political fodder, who would take the heat, get impeached and then Pence would look like a hero for supporting the impeachment. I think instead we should have another election..and I don't know put some money into the election system which hasn't seen change in like 20 years. Most important political process in the world, and it's done about as elegant as a DMV. Why is it easier to order a pizza with a push of a button but to vote we have to take a day off and wait in long lines. Then again votes don't matter in most non-swing states anyway so...le sigh.."
yet one more great show....did the like and share thing.....star wars pic in back ground still not straight...all good my helps keep my o.c.d. on point.
"Hi Phil first time writing to a video to you like your work you try to keep the news straight and informitive.  On the whole Trump Jr.  story if that is a criminal than all the donations from foreign nations to the partys'(dems,reps) or foundation of the politician is a criminal offence of the law so put all the effort to go through all donations and if any come from a foreign nation than arrest them for the violation of the law. Now is that news or a witch hunt because a POTUS had different views from the last POTUS one who treated the nation as a charity for the world and didn't help the USA but hurt it as a whole and if you didn't know Obama is going around the world acting like an in office POTUS(even when his terms' are over) and that is criminal and is in violations of the Logan act (is a United States federal law that details the fine and/or imprisonment of unauthorized citizens who negotiate with foreign governments having a dispute with the United States. It was intended to prevent the undermining of the government's position example. The Act was passed following George Logan's unauthorized negotiations with France in 1798, and was signed into law by President John Adams on January 30, 1799. The Act was last amended in 1994, and violation of the Logan Act is a felony. Source(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Act) ). Please what is your opinion on Obama acting as an in office POTUS even out of terms' and going to different nations and negotiating on the USA's behalf??"
"The main issue with all nations and all men is that they as individuals believe their right to make an opinion, means their opinion is valid. Two people can make an opinion about rice. If one is based upon facts then that opinion is of greater value and is valid. The lesser opinion in turn is less valuable and has less validity. 

Vanity, Prejudice, Intolerance, and Ignorance are in my own opinon the great roots of evil. Yet it is Pride that leads to such roots.


Mankind is too arrogent to change, we can try, but mans pride has caused wars, greed, corruption, and sorrow. Only in humility can we ever hope to achieve profound change.

Lets take for example the intolerant fools in the comment section who believe all liberals or conservatives are intolerant and racist. Logic its self tells us such an opinion is factually incorrect, yet these people who claim they want change continue to label and believe stereotypes. It is not only the governments which have fallen from grace, it is the people of those nations. 

We have foolish adults who take offense for this that are not offensive, BLM is a prime example. This movement feels obligated to speak when every a black man is killed by a white man or any polics officer, yet they remain silent when a Black person kills another Black person. The people of many nations have grown hypocritical and want many imoral ans objectively wrong things to be legal.

I presume our countries shall collapse just as Ancient Rome did.

Before we fix any country, we must first evaluate our own hearts and resolve those roots that exist in our own hearts."
"I am so sick of people trying to use the faults or wrongdoings of one political party to justify the actions of the other. L ""Trump did so and so.""  R "" yeah well Hillary's emails"" lmao. And before anyone starts assuming Shit I did not and do not support Hillary or Trump. Like Phil just said it shouldn't matter what side they are on. That being said I also believe that our president (no matter who or what party holds the position) should be held to a higher standard and expected to act admirably so they represent our country in the most positive way."
planet of the apes isn't racist what's In your comment section definitely is
"Identitarians are a fucking cancer to society. They're nothing but Nazis who lack the balls to say they're nazis. As such, they should be ridiculed and called out. Millions of people died because of Nazism and we better not forget that because if we do, we'll have WW3 in our hands. the USA have already fallen, what with electing Trump, the closest thing to a Nazi that American politics could think of and Europe is in danger of going the same way. 

And to all those who say ""Yeah, maybe we should wage a war against Islam, maybe a WW3 would be a good thing, because our culture is better"", I say this: ""Yeah, maybe our culture is objectively better, but if you want a war, you, your family, all of it, your friends, all the people you love, they all die. Do you want that? Is this the hill you all want to die? Don't ask for war if you and the people close to you are not willing to go to war and die in gruesome agony because of that idea. It's very easy to be a warmonger from the rear, but if you want war, you should be the one to go to that meat grinder called the front, so shut the fuck up""."

"I'm black and I do love my people, but, sometimes it gets on my nerves when people like Tariq turn everything into a race thing. Yes I understand there are bad people in this world who are racist but you can't target a whole race based on one guys actions. News flash not everyone is out to get you, all your doing is making yourself look bad. Just stop."
"Ok we've humored Dems with this Russia stuff long enough.   NONE of this is illegal, it has been done repeatedly in the past by Hillary and Obama.  Of course Russia  wanted Trump to win.  Who flipping cares!"
"I think it's pronounced dee-ray, Phil."
You keep using that word. I don't think it means what you think it means.
I'm sick and tired of the media's unhealthy obsession with Trump and Russia
"I am going to over extend and claim that aliens are of my likeness.
I am insulted and aghast over this blatant racism.

Pay attention to me."
Let's be real there's a very small chance anything actually happens to trump jnr

"I think it's very possible that the Russian meeting does in fact fall under the category of ""other thing of value."" Dirty laundry on either candidate could have been easily sold to any number of legitimate and not-so-legitimate media outlets, or persons involved in campaigns or politics in general. If it can be sold, it has value."

Antifa is a terrorist organization
"Heard a lawyer on t.v. say this about junior:
Sinful, immoral, wrong: yes, but not illegal."
"The Trump Jr story seems pretty insignificant to me.  The meeting was revealed long ago, the topic was Russian adoptions...and so far no real evidence it was anything more.  I don't really care if he said ""No meetings were set up"" and now we find out a meeting was set up...whoop de doo.  Maybe he forgot because it was so minor or maybe he lied...so?  Politicians and businessmen lie all the time.  An honest politician would be awesome, but the reality is that most are not very honest."
"Phil, I don't think people assault others they think are nazis to ""further a cause"". They do it because they hate them and want to punch them. You're over-analyzing the thought process behind ""fuck you, nazi""."
"Phil I know you talked about a lot of serious topics but this is off topic. Where did you get that rocket raccoon from? Every time I watch your video, I tell myself ""I WANT IT"". Thanks."
"Meanwhile at the DNC, screw Sanders & lets bathe in our money from Saudi Arabia... Nothing to see here."
Why people are FREAKING OUT over overly dramatic titles.
"You guys know that Sjw's and Blacks aren't totally synonymous, right? I know it seems hard to believe for a few of you, but conservative blacks exist, and they frown upon the stupidity of Blm as well."

where's the secret link? sad face
"funny how that lawyer used a Shakespeare reference ""In my opinion this is Much Ado About Nothing"" where in Shakespeare's play ""Nothing"" was an allusion to genitalia."
So we burn both the DNC and Hillary Clinton at the stake and use the Trump administration as the firewood? I'm okay with this.
does that mean BLM gets offended at nature for making apes or
"I think one big problem in American politics today is a lack of compromise. People today seem to think that one side should get everything they want and the other side should get nothing. We could resolve things much more quickly and much more civilly if we would accept that we can't have everything we want just because we think we're on the ""right"" side. But that would require understanding people we don't agree with and apparently we seem to have become rather incapable of that...smh"
Governments working =D
"Phil, your opinion is gospel to me. I rarely disagree with any of your opinions because you're very logical. The only time i have ever disagreed with you that i can remember is when you said Idris Elba should be the next James Bond. James Bond is based off a combination of real life colleagues of Ian Fleming. They were white, not black. No i am not racist I'm just saying James Bond should never be black!"
"But Phil, ""Despacito"" hasn't even been out for a year and as of now has over 2 BILLION views. Im pretty sure it will be #1 in no time"

"You heard it here first! Philip DeFranco is a Trump Supporter! /s   No seriously though Phil I love your show, because you're very unbiased and give us more insight than mainstream media. Kudos."

Is it immoral for me to reveal information about a candidate simply because they're in a different country?
I don't get this."
"These fucking left-wing radicals are smashing an entire city to pieces, injur 200 police, throw rocks at firefighters and stalk and attack journalists they don't agree with. These people are cancer, and our government displays no will of dealing with them. And on top of all of that, the media are vomiting out apologia and straight up lies to protect those assholes, as most journos here are themselves left-wingers.

They will trash this country, and there will be civil war. Mark my words. Germany's going down the drain."
I actually thought that dude was in the movie... my bad
"In short, Don Jr wanted to hear how Hillary colluded with Russia. What's bad about that?"

"As for those hunting down and attacking the 4 who were there to cover the Summit, you are cowards and psychopaths. Since when has a difference of opinion, which is essentially just air to begin with, a cause or justification to terrorize others with the intention of inflicting pain? What and who does that sound like??? Hmmmmm Oh yeah! ISIS. You are either auditioning for a role in ISIS or just complete and cruel assholes."
My parents were very much married when I was born. Your constant referral to me as a bastard is thus rendered unnecessary

"I'm so fucking sick of hearing about Russian, if a Russian bear wondered into Alaska and took a shit in front of a cabin Donald Trump once stayed at there would be a week long fucking CNN investigation"
Same kind of protests happened at the Toronto G20 summit. It was chaos and neither the cops nor the protesters were without blame in the end.
"""of value"" is way too vague. Wouldn't hold up in appeals. Vagueness in a law means the law is unlikely to be upheld in court. If Libs are looking for a smoking gun, this sure as hell isn't it."
Oh yeah shit I heard about Lauren Southern's encounter with Antifa
"There's a difference between politics and the real world in terms of whether or not it's worth drawing lines in the sand for what is ""moral"" and what is not. In politics, it's a really good move because it keeps people on your side thinking you hold the fabled Moral High Ground‚Ñ¢ and that you're therefore the better position to have (read: it makes your position easier to advertise). In the real world, this is a horrible move because it allows groups who already give zero fucks about those lines to stomp over those that do. This makes solving problems involving these groups incredibly difficult because it's nearly impossible to stop shitty people without actual force. I'd rather have members of oppressive groups be shot than have people who would never be heard by these groups in the first place just say they don't like what's happening. Of fucking course you don't like what's happening, but they don't give a fuck. They want shit their way, and saying otherwise doesn't fix it; it just gets you hated by them. I'm not saying violence is always or often the answer, but the sad truth is that sometimes it is. What do you think wars are for?"
"I wonder if you noticed that both you and Stephen Colbert pointed out that what Don Jr is basically saying is ""We tried to collude, but we weren't able to""?"
"Why can't we just get along? One person has their opinions and the next has theirs. We're all human. We all think our views are the best for everyone that's why we try to enforce them and tell other people. But stop being so violent and harsh about it. I'm neither liberal or conservative more of right in the middle of both. I respect both parties however even if I disagree on some of their views. Calling people ""libtards"" or ""fucking asshole idiots"" doesn't get us anywhere now does it?"
I love how people say violence doesn't solve problems and it doesn't puss things I'm guessing you should say that to the natives or the people that went fought the British when they tired to take over The states or the flight for the slaves. Sometimes you need to fight to get your rights that's what America is all about.

America is destroying itself with extremists on both sides. It will cause its own downfall.
"Picked up? That is a fucking way of saying ""SENDING it antifa in hopes of serious harm to Lauren and co or even the death of said people.""

"Can yall not watch phils show anymore? Retards that think ""every liberal/conservative"" etc. Is exactly what phil and myself are against and you make The Nation look bad for it. phil has shown definitive proof that both parties have scum in it so why the fuck do you still spout this bullshit that YOUR party isnt at fault.. retard. - to everyone posting blanket statements :) ,,l,,"

"It's worse than violent elements hurting their cause by BOLO-ING Tim Pool and Luke and all. It makes journalists afraid to cover events, and also makes regular people who want to express themselves in a group like this stay home.

at least he released the email and didnt delete thousands of email like HRC if he had something to hide he wouldnt post the emails

I think it's funny niggers see themselves in the apes
"What if this information was given to Trump by any other country? Obviously the way the Russia thing has been explained doesn't make them similar but I feel like with every country wanting another's government to move in their political direction this would be the way to interact with changing elections. Is it shady? Hell yeah. But does it mean the Trump administration was knowingly let everything happen? I don't think so. It seems too well formulated for the administration when it hadn't even have the lead in the primaries. The hackings were going to take place regardless in favor of Republicans by Russia. Trump's campaign isn't smart enough to be in that deep but they reaped the benefits of it. That's my opinion. Don't get me wrong this big scandal sounds like the perfect story to take down any tyrant, but it just seems too good, too involved, to be true."
How is stalking and violence for the purposes of physical intimidation (because of someones political views) anti fascist and anti nazi exactly. Isnt that how germans treated jews right before the holocaust? The attitudes of the far left paralell those of nazis and communists. Their acts of violence and childish riots are eerily similar to kristallnacht and Stalin's purge. Governments in the west need to stand up to these violent acts and quit rolling over for fear of being called racist. Words=Retaliation of WORDS(NOT VIOLENCE)

"This is mostly unrelated to Phil's show today, but can we just get the Trump family out of the government now....then almost everyone can be happy.

"People still defending Trump amazes me. Attempting to rig an election to become the most powerful man on earth is actually one the highest crimes one can possibly commit, right after assassinating the president.

1. ""See you again"" past Psy because paul walkers death and wiz khalifa. NOT because he is a youtube creator. You are glad that Psy is not top viewed video?

REALLY? who even fucking knew puth was a YT creator before that song? maybe some people, but it wasn't WHERE HE GOT his CELEBRITY CREDS. You racist bastard.
2. Don Jr..'s emails  are SO full of blatant undermining of the american presidential race, I am still thinking, ""WOW! the biggest Trump spin dr. IS PHIL!"" This is more proof than anyone EVER had on Clinton, and you know what? who even cares about left or right anymore? Can't you just use your common sense to see that Trump is a terrible choice the republicans chose as THEIR REPRESENTATIVE? Anybody would b better for republican president! HELL. I'll even switch parties and vote for phil (republican),  even though he takes no accountability for his support of trump, meaning he literally can't b trusted. i dont even care anymore if i am labeled. all i care about is the american citizens.

"Phil at what point and after how much violence and looting can we call Antifa a terrorist organization? In my opinion, New Jersey got this 1 right by officially declaring Antifa domestic terrorists.  I think it would go a long way for media, even independent media like you, to start referring  to them as such. There are a lot of videos showcasing all the looting and violence committed by Antifa at the G20 and other protests. Why not show them or at least show some of them so that people who attend future protests know how dangerous these people are? I feel like the media and content makers who don't bring this up when talking about this subject are, in a small way, helping put people at risk.  ."
"It wasn't illegal because they got the information from someone that wasn't associated with the Russian government. (Both the lawyer and Russian government have denied it). It wasn't the Russian government giving this information to him. Where Hilldog was actually colluding, Don Jr. and The President himself didn't. This entire thing just blew up because Liberals want some dirt on Russia. Just like how they kept bringing up Russia hacking the election which has been proven time and time again to be false. C'mon people."
"Phillyy Phil!!! On a flight and getting crazy turbulence and super happy for the free wifi. (I HATE FLYING üôÑ) Because I am binge watching you, the Vlog and the DeFrance Fam!  Thanks for all you do and just being a great human. I appreciate you and all you do. Keep up the good fight! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ALL HAIL THE LORD SUPREME GOD EMPEROR PRESIDENT TRUMP!!!!!
I also watch kimmy kimmel. I prefer him over fimmy Fallon.
"I love you phil. I've been subscribed for almost seven years, but I think the time has come. You're quality hasn't diminished, even though I really don't like the new video titles, I just think I'm done with hearing about all these horrible negative things all the time. 
Thank you for getting me through some rough days, and showing me new perspectives. I hope to get to meet you one day and express my gratitude for what you do. Goodbye sxephil"
"Philip I know you promote equal representation of people's opinions, and you are always very neutral on issues, but holy shit the comments on your videos are becoming a right wing soapbox."
"it is actually insulting that they compared the ape 2 him. they should apologize 2 the ape. it already is proven that antifa is a terrorist group. the donald trump jr story isn' big, but the regressive altleft twist what happened and lied and made it big"
"""We tried to collude, we couldn't figure it out.."" ... considering the family you are talking about that statement has a LEGITIMATE shot at being 100% true LOL"
"Bro, bro bro, I'm trying to hold on as a fan but this video was complete and utter white male privilege bullshit! You are playing fool not to notice the timing and effort into making the one monkey stand out replicating the image of a current activist! This video will bite you in the end. Never ever ever try to solve or speak on tensions you are insensitive to. You just played yourself by playing popular."
"The Deray Mckesson story is just another example of the ""Once you are convinced the world is racist/sexist/etc., that is all you will see"" style of confirmation bias"
"Protesters in Hamburg remind me of zenyatta from OW. They are like ""they will learn of our peaceful ways through violence""a"
So Jr. agreed to a meeting; and then after he agreed to the meeting he was told there might be helpful information?
Germany is turning into a shit hole fast now they are full communist trying to overthrown the government
"How to go to these kinds of protests now. Bring mace and hide it for protection, dress like an Abnegation from Divergent(a.k.a. all grey, no logos, symbols, or words), and wear a hat (also no logos or colors other than grey) and/or something else that covers your face so it doesn't offend anyone. Try not to reveal your ethnicity at all and you're like, 74% safe depending on your luck. If you really want to be safe, stay at home, lock your doors, and disconnect from all and any social media until the buzz about the protests fades."
I thought it was Tana on the thumbnail üòÇ
Am I the only one that noticed it said 'Kimmy Kimmel' and not 'JIMMY Kimmel' lol
"all that needs to happen is for trump to impeached,his son thrown in jail,then have them both executed"
Hillary had practically the whole media colluding with her to take the white house.
"G20 Protest?
No. 
G20 Terrorist."
"Lauren Southern is an attention whore that lives in a conservative echochamber.  Phil, she's a professional victim.  That's what she does. She goes to places, does something inflammatory, then is ""victimized"" when people aren't having it."
Where's the secret link?
"Can trump jr. just be pardoned if he is in violation of the law? Just wonder if this is a ""nothing burger""."
buttery males
"As far as Russian involvement in the election, the goal posts have constantly shifted. At first it was all about Russia 'hacking the election', a narrative that implied they had manipulated votes. That then changed to 'Russia hacked the DNC', despite wikileaks stating it was a DNC insider that gave them the documents, and the US gov never actually giving substantial evidence to support their claim. Now the goal posts have shifted yet again, to simply be 'Russian officials tried to give trump dirt on Hilary'. 

I personally don't see what the issue is. If they were  actively manipulating votes or funding his campaign, sure, I could see why this would be a concern. When it's just individuals talking though, I don't see that as an issue. After all, information is just information. If that information is damaging, then it's damaging regardless of the source it comes from, and potentially regardless of whether or not it's true. 

I think the left wing media in the US needs to get over their Trump Russia obsession and  focus on more important things."
can u mention macklemores new music vid:)
"Phil; Please stop acknowledging the bullshit narrative of the Left - Right paradigm, as reported by the American media. You're reinforcing the lie that's directly causing the problem. 
Just because some of the media is less-right than the openly fascist, doesn't make it represent the left. 
YOU could bring the reality to your audience, instead of giving both sides fraudulent credibility."
You certainly have a way about you that helps me understand complex issues without dumbing them down.  You're great!
Fuck these antifa morons
"It seems like everytime I see comments on the internet, the poster is usually overreaching, I wish people would fight clean, it makes your argument more valid."
Antifa are more facist than the millions of people they call Nazis just for disagreeing with them.

"Yeah, we need to investigate the Clinton thing, but, like, she's not the president. Not highest priority, and no where near as high priority as the collusion with out CURRENT president."
why haven't you covered the real story that boneless wings are nuggets???
"What I hate most about this whole Russia, Trump, Clinton, and Presidential (if you can even call this presidential) kerfuffle is the stance that is being held by nearly everyone, 'If you're not for us, you're against us.""

That mindset has absolutely no value in this day and age. There is exactly zero professionalism in that. Don't look at my respectless act, look at theirs! Do not yell at me for doing this, look what they've done!  

My service that I have given is now looking completely regretted. Something I thought was impossible."
bring back the intro

"I agree with Phil when he said ""You don't own wearing blue vest"".
If you want to be identified thru something that you wear, make it something like Casey Neistat's old pair of sunglasses. :)"
Im glad Tariq is finally pointing out Hollywoods common far right leaning politics.

Unjust shooting of Philando Castile...... I really hope you never get pulled over Defranco if you have a firearm on you or in the vehicle. The man had a permit to carry and I see either one of two things went wrong. He forgot the correct actions to take when pulled over with a firearm or the required training he received to get his permit was done poorly. If you ever get pulled over with a firearm you should always put your hands in a visible location such as the dashboard and not move at all and tell the officer you have a firearm. Afterwards the officer will instruct you on what to do next. Trying to reach for something after telling a cop you have a firearm and the cop tells you three times to basically stop (Don't pull it out) is a bad idea.
I love it how everything in this world is always said to be offensive and racist. people need to quit crying about everything
"Conservative sees Hamburg riots : All Progressives and Liberals are terrorists. 

Conservative sees BLM riots : BLM is a terrorist organization and all black people who support it are bad. 

When white people do bad things conservatives attack their ideals and morals and not their race but when minorities do bad things their race is the only thing harped on. I'm not supporting the destruction, looting, and attacking of officers but there are so many instances where conservatives, anti-BLM, anti-fem, etc argue the whole ""the actions of a few do not represent the majority"" for whatever fits their agenda but then others do it and its somehow wrong. I'm open for debate, I will not censor you, and will respect your opinion even if I don't a agree."
1billion views are at least from me.. Great Song
"so german people call others nazis, but they bully and harass innocent people like a nazi? man for real everyday i thank god for being a white man born in the states. u s of a baybay"

"Trump Jr. did nothing illegal. See https://www.fec.gov/updates/foreign-nationals/

""Volunteer activity

Generally, an individual (including a foreign national) may volunteer personal services to a federal candidate or federal political committee without making a contribution. The Act provides this volunteer ""exemption"" as long as the individual performing the service is not compensated by anyone. The Commission has addressed applicability of this exemption to several situations involving volunteer activity by a foreign national, as explained below.""

However, Hillarys campaign likely received foreign funds from places like Saudi Arabia.

3:40 when the american is called a nazi by a german
I did the same thing so I understand but you're reading the messages backwards. Look at the time stamps.
No secret link?
Love Lauren but her comment section on her YouTube vids are cancerous.
You should put a link to the video shirts originated from on the page of the shirts
Anti-fa's cause IS to hurt others.
Booooo @ short video
What's up you beautiful mother fucker.
"Information is far more valuable than money but in my opinion in the context of the law as it is now Trump Jr did nothing wrong. athe law should be changed to classify information as a ""thing of value"""
"I support BLM, and Deray has done good work with campaign zero, but he is way of base here. That being said BLM is a very divided movement. There doesn't seem to be a clear platform that people are advocating for, just a mess of anger and a need for change."
Fuck the antifa fascists.
"The left after the DNC leaks:  Raaah, scandel!  They had no right to release stolen information!

The left after the Trump Jr leaks:  Yeah!  Evil! We don't care how this information was released!

Apparently they only care when it's in their favor :\"
enough comments peasants!  Philips opinion is gospel!
I'm confused as to what these protesters are so angry about. Can some one please enlighten me?
fuck phil why do you only cover when activist fuck up?
"Much better job today on covering the Trump Jr. meeting.  Yesterday's was pathetic, always a bad decision to take a Russian at their word, of course she lied about not being part of the Russian gov.  Shifting the argument to Hillary is a silly tactic, saying Hillary is corrupt, yeah no shit.  Investigate her too, but Trump still did illegal shit.  Lock them both up.  Better yet, lock them up together and film them for a reality show."
Thank you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How in the fuck what the philando case unjustified dude??
"Confirmed, Putin has a peepee tape on Dump"
Wait what??
I'm so fucking done with Donald Trump and the all American government. I'm just tired of hearing about it.  Like just chill for a week and then if you feel like it continue to break the law and make drama out of nothing because.
"Fuck you Phil Im not beautiful! D:<

"so glad watsky is still kicking, been a while, since his dumbfoundead days that i checked him out. good to see a call out for him!"
I'll side with Stefan Molyneux on this case...
"Since when is being a Nationalist make you a Nazi or Fascist? 


P.S. BLM, Feminists, Antifa and the like also fall under the identitarian definition."
"I gave up giving a damn about politics and feel much better since. It's like having a detox, taking walks with my girl when the news is on tv instead of watching it. No late night talk show comedians. I swear it's like a happier life not getting bombarded with that crap daily."
Not for long top video. Soon it will be DESPACITO
"I don't think Trump Jr did anything wrong, and I doubt anything will come of this."
I want to marry Lauren!
Why did Lauren apologize? The fuck? She did nothing wrong
"personally dont care about the information stuff from either side. mainly cuz its information. if the campaigns dug it up themselves, theyd be allowed to use it.  but looks like don jr did lie. what a dumb ass."
Phil you're still rockin that 3BH logo on your lamps.  You Sir are a class act :)
"He isn't a self-proclaimed activist... He is an activist!!  That statement may have made you feel comfortable because some may say you are a ""self-proclaimed"" journalist... but you do the job, right?¬†Show some respect. An apology is needed for you overlooking and downplaying his actions. It came off as intentional bias when we alllll know, you know better."
wondring if anyone gonna look inn to all the money Hillary got from foren countrys
The ape had a blue vests so it racist? Some one explain please
I think all this fuss would end with a blanket pardon from the President :P
sooooooo sick of this Russia this and Russia that. Nothing is going to come out of it...... Honestly it's EXACTLY like the Clinton e-mail investigation. In the end it will be a big waist of time and Both Left and Right will just point fingers for the next 4 years. I'm mentally checked out. At this point I just don't care.
Your point about trump AND Hillary is why I enjoy your content. Im no big trump fan but im so tired of every news outlet trying to completely smear him.. its getting old. You give both sides of stories a fair chance regardless of personal opinions and that's refreshing these days.
"Both Hillary and Trump (and whom ever helped them) belong in prison. Corruption is in the government, but this is on an insane level. Make an example of both of everyone involved."
lololololol Nazi > Supremacist > Identitarian fucking lol always changing names to hide what they stand for.
"he says, ""you probably think this song is about you"" üòÇüòÇüòÇahahahahaha!"
knew he could cover the violence @ G20
"The great thing about Theories is they are just unfactual speculation. They can't get anything on Trump or his relatives. So they have to stretch context of a law to try to get something on them. I mean someone said they had something dirty going on with your enemy that shall incriminate them. Of course, you're going to want to see it. Anyone says otherwise is a liar. Nothing is illegal about it looking at it or revealing it. No matter if it is offered or not. Bullshit is all that it is. They are pulling strawman."
Hotep Jesus made the show
Every one is angry over the video and I'm here like you misspelled Maine.
"Just say who they were, the violent G20 rioters were Europes Antifa, it was fucking Antifa!"
Yo didn't Bill Clinton get paid half a million fucking dollars from Russia while his wife was sec. of state?
EVERYONE TO PSY üòÇüòÇüòÇ
ok guys whats an ideniterian?
I think you need to stop using NYT and CNN as sources.
"Could you cover the disappearance of four teenage boys from Bucks County, Pennsylvania?"
"Er... the last I checked they already investigated Hillary's administration and they came up with nothing. I don't buy this false equivalence that because the Trump administration might be guilty of something, that automatically means Hillary is as well. That's just a f**king ridiculous argument."
If you saw that Planet Of The Apes trailer and instantly thought of black people.... YOU'RE the racist. Plain and simple.
At what point did we stop using the term Neo-Nazi and start calling people Nazi's.
"I have to disgaree with your ""Stop hurting your cause with violence."" violence is the voice of the opressed. The top elites use it ALL the time to keep the lower people in check. Hell, without violence we would not even be here today. In short, I understanding where you come from by saying stop hurting a cause by acting a fool, but how long are people to remain silent and ignorant until a full on riot breaks out again? So just sit down, be quiet and wait for it's our turn to speak?"
Secret Link Of The Day be so secret I can't even find it...
There is something I always have to google when I watch Phil! Damn Phil making me learn! üòä
"WHERE'S THE SECRET LINK, PHIL???? IT'S MY BIRTHDAY AND I NEED THE SECRET LINK AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT!"
Can we just get a break from all the things that happen in the world and realize how fucking amazing it is that one single YouTube video can get almost 3 views.
The problem with the internet is people who use meaningful trends for dumb arguments that taint the message of the movement...like associating Black Lives Matter with a monkey in a vest in a movie? Really? THAT'S what people choose to get mad at these days?
Protests become riots when the police get involved in a hostile way
my bf said he's tapping the bottom of the screen while watching u cause ur hand movements r driving him nuts.
"They do know the apes win in the end, right? ü§î"
"so during the election it was shown that hillary and the DNC received millions of dollars indirectly from several foreign governments, and they cried foul that trump was doing something similar with russia. it is now proven that his son tried to get his hands on information from russia to help swing the election.

so it would seem i am still right in that he was the lesser of two evils, that he is a horrible candidate that only won due to the fact that hillary was even worse. so the question is do we hit both with the law or just find a way to keep this from happening in the future?"
Wait.. Aren't we all literally apes?
Seems like it might be time to start taking shots.
I don't agree with the identitarian movement but once you attack or physically harm someone who doesn't agree with your opinions you become a complete garbage nothingburger.
Yo didn't Obama produce a fucking video to show support for Macron?
I LOVE LAUREN SOUTHERN
"Lmao HA! Nazis calling Americans ""Nazis"" fucking priceless"
That's it. All hope lost. Humanity is going to cry itself to death with made up racism cases. This is the saddest generation in history.
Fuck ANTIFA if you identify with them you are a piece of human filth.
"As a government employee, a 'thing of value' is a very defined object within the law and is a part of just about every ethics law in every state and federal government. Basically, it means monetary value, with a few exceptions, as items whose intent is to advertise is not considered a thing of value, like a hat with a company logo, pens, pencils etc otherwise stamped for the intent of the object is clearly advertisement so someone doesn't just put a logo on a sports car and say it has no value. Some states consider event tickets 'things of value' others don't, some consider meals above around the per diem rate for a meal as having value, some don't and some consider any meal or food not consumed in the presence of the giver. Information is never considered value unless there is money transferred because the money itself would have value, not the information."
yu are funny
where's the secret link?
Even with the editing about 5 minutes of this 11:36 video are watchable .
5:40 What about the Evolution of Dance?
"Jeez Phil, another great vid as usual. Great with some lunch!

Want to say again I really appreciate how you don't lecture or condescend. You give your own opinion (Usually fair and balanced which is awesome) and leave the floor open to us

Just a fantastic refreshing format, love some non-partisan vids. Keep it up!"
"It's like the boy who cried wolf, keep faking racism like the monkey in the vest and people won't take you seriously when real racism happens"
"Oh look, Antifa being violent again! No wonder the Majority of people refer to them as a Domestic Terrorist Group. They seem to think they're in the right, funny isn't it? they hate Nazism, but ... why is it they seem to resemble Nazi's more than today's 'Nazi' ... which by the way, if these Antifa punks ever met a true Nazi, you know ... the people involved in the Nazi Socialist Party during WW2 - pretty sure they'd shit themselves.

Terrorism: the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims."
Where's the secret link of the day Phil?
I love when we just jump into it <3
damn why would you WANT to be known wearing that vest. it's heinous
"Trump just threw Manafort and Kushner under the bus (Trump, Jr didn't fill out a national security clearance form while the other two did). He also implicated his dad since Trump tweeted about Hillary's e-mails just 10 minutes after the meeting ending. If I were Congress, I would start passing laws with two party support to real in the powers ceded to the Presidency over the decades until this matter gets settled. 

Part of me thinks that Russia now is going to cut ties with Trump, and slowly release all the embarrassing and illegal information about his regime in order to undermine the office of the presidency fully."
"If you actually watch the old Planet of the Apes movies from back in the day, they were definitely racist as be lol"
"Fuck antifa I don't always agree with Lauren but shes not a Fascist in any way. She's a conservative with libertarian ideals, and Tim Pool (such as my-self) identifies as a classical liberal!!!  Before doing something stupid use your brain and think first!!!"
"I'm just saying how many times do we see those shows where the pedophile set's up a to meet up with a kid ends up meeting with cops and go's to jail and we all go yay put that XYZ in jail or someone try's to by drugs ends up Buying sugar or whatever from Police and end up in jail, we all said that was a crime, go to jail, Trump Jr and trumps son-in-law did the exact same thing they tried to do something illegal ended up with nothing but still try to do something illegal, if there's proof that both (campaigns) did that and they both should be held accountable."
AntiFa are violent terrorists that should be rounded up and thrown into the Mediterranean to swim with the Islamic militants they love so much.
WHERE DA SECRET LINK
Lauren though is a Nazi and a racist so her views don't matter.
niggers get mad so easy

"I'm thinking ""Have I ever seen DeFranco in a collared shirt before???"""
why doesn't he use secure emails???
Both sides are corrupt as fuck. This is why people dont vote.
"Comedian Drew Lynch (from AGT) also wears a blue puffy vest a lot, maybe the ape is supposed to have a stutter?"
ANTIFA ARE the fascists! It's called projection.
"I love that comment, ""We tried to collude! We couldn't figure it out!"" I personally, as a journalist even, feel overwhelmed by all the information and am waiting for more information to be released before making a definitive decision about whether or not collusion happened. At this point I'm just exhausted."
People are always looking for offense.
Defranco listens to Watsky?? People actually know Watsky exists???
BROO LAUREN SOUTHERN IS HOT
"If Trump Jr. did do any collusion it was collusion talks to find PROOF of Hillary's actual collusion deals. Someone snooping through your stuff to prove you did something wrong is guilty, of snooping, while you're still guilty of what ever they find. That's why people see Trump as the ""lesser of two evils""."
You are now aware of all of Phil's hand movements.
"Is it illegal to try and get information on bad things other candidates have done? If it is, wouldn't that be backwards? I'd think it would be completely allowed because the whole point of the campaign is to choose a leader who is the best out of the bunch, and making it illegal to try and bring their doings further into the light seems sketchy and wrong."
Hey Phil I love the show but thought that the G20 segment was a bit rushed and kind of poorly explained. Is this due to you trying to shorten the length of your videos? recently your video lengths appear to have shortened by about 5 minutes so I was just wondering if this was a side effect of this. also if so why have you decided to shorten the video length recently? thanks. love the show.
No one ever said authoritarians were smart.
"As far as the first story with Deray, was it silly? Sure! But I don't think it totally undermines all of his work. I think we all get a little too caught up sometimes in thinking that one thing derails everything else a person stands for."
Trump is the money maker for everyone nowadays. Almost every video here has a story related to him. It's getting kind of  boring.
Hey Phil why are people always freaking out?
"I have looked over the video's description 4 damn times and I still can't find the secret link. Also, I loved today's video. It was amazing. Back to the link, where the fuck is it? And don't message back with ""It's a secret""."
"@Philip DeFranco¬† This family over at The Daily Dose may count as abuse to a younger kid named Trent in there video, Trent Gets jumped live on stream. At about 18 mins."
im really getting tired of this russia shit you know

... Psy debuted in 2001... üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"I like your show and I've been watching for a while but every time I hear ""let's just jump into it"" it makes me cringe."
"If i was the Trumps,  I wouldn't have released the emails.  I would have  just deleted them, and said we learned from Hillary on what to do.  With a smile on my face."
Disappointed in all the people trash talking and treating Muslims like we are garbage. What if someone treats you like that! You'd feel so sad. Thanks a lot. I hope something shows you how trashy you are.
"lmao, a german man telling an american ge is a Nazi. But wait weren't the germans the Nazi's?"
That girl literally deserves anything she gets sorry but all the things she has said about trans people is just so sad she's the one who's really intolerant I don't get how someone's gender affects you it's as simple as someone's name call them what they like If you forget simply apologize and move on
"Antifa is full of anarcho-communist cancer. They should be considered terrorists around the world, they have no respect for private property and will fuck everything up. The worst part is they are not fighting against the ""evil capitalist high class"", but instead they are ruining hard working middle-class citizens that are now in trouble because a bunch of hooded assholes looted their stores and burned their cars."
"lol what an idiot. ""You do not own wearing blue vests"" haha"
"First off BLM is bunch of racist idiots. None of there points should really be taken into account. All I see is every time a black person get shot by the police even when the cops had the right to do so or or self defense, they riot along with all the racist things I see from them on twitter. They are proof racism is allowed today its just if your racist towards white people its more accepted. Last time I checked all racism is bad."
Deray is a clown. He's always been a clown and he'll always be a clown. The shooting of Castille was unjustified though and the cop should be in jail.
BLM have always been a bunch of self obsessed narcissistic morons.
"You're quote of law doesn't specify 'who' that is applicable to. For example, are you saying that a canadian cannot donate to a political party during election times? I bet there would be tons of people guilty of something similar. Also, morally? Bro, the government colludes with all kinds of crazy people and dictators. This is tame compared to what is really going on in the world."
"Ya know, although the BLM guys giving Planet of The Apes flak were rightly called out, at this point I can almost ABSOLUTELY assume that the Most Requested Story of The Day will be about¬†bashing the left. Very telling about the denizens of the Nation..."
"I will never forgive this racist meme for prohibiting us from enjoying Obama chimp caricatures the same way we did with George Bush. They both had the ears.
. . .They both had the ears. . . 
You racist maniacs. You fucked it up. Ah, damn you! Goddamn you all to hell!"
Trump - NOTHING TO SEE HERE.
Philly d how do you know the shooting of Castile was unjustice?
Black people always playing the victim for no relevant reason.
"The ape with the blue vest does stick out, considering it's the only one wearing any clothes, but you have to be more than a little narcissistic and paranoid to think that is a jab at you personally. Plus if we're going to apply the logic of ""these apes must represent black people"" to every Planet of the Apes movie, than clearly in the 2001 movie, the black people ruled the world, and owned the white people as slaves. Yeah, I'm sure that's the message!....... Or, maybe we just shouldn't take a work of fiction so seriously."
"Philip knows who Watsky is, what the hell"
"this meeting with this russian lawyer happened before any mention of Russia hacking into the DNC occured. at this time, there was no reason for djt jr. to expect this was anything other than oppo research on a political opponent, which is very common. further more, he is not in the administration nor does he have a security clearance, so there was no reason for him to disclose any of these meetings. all that being said, this is definitely a moral issue and should have never occurred. But what this is not, is some smoking gun that proves Trump himself and Putin are buddies, and cooperated in stealing the election from Hillary. Yes Russia tried to get Trump elected, and yes Trump is uncomfortably warm towards Putin, but this is not some treasonous act."
"What is Identarianism, anyways?"
"So now there's proof (coming from the Trump camp) that:
- The Trump campaign actively sought information from Russian sources that were ""very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government support for Mr. Trump""
- It was Trump's inner circle (his son, his son-in-law now advisor and campaign manager), not some rogue agent. 
- There's a timeline of Trump surrogates making public statements related to information found in Russian hacks before they were made public (e.g. Wikileaks). 
- Proof that all of them are lying saying there was no contact between the Trump campaign and Russians (Pence, Sessions, Trump, Trump Jr.)

So for all the Trumpsters that have been asking for proof, well Trump Jr. just provided it and in the process confirmed he's a liar. 
Not that this would change those idiots minds but at least they should so some self reflection on their allegiance and stop with the hypocrisy. Congress will let them get away with anything. 

Edit: Interesting how the Trumpsters are quiet today. Could this be the straw that broke the camels back?"
"You simply don't go to Germany and try them in aspects related to a hurtful past. Also I gotta say that normally, people in Germany are not aggresive in this manner, and it was just a few people that decided to say 'no, fuck off', but they do NOT represent everyone in Germany. Those foreigners (I think many of them Americans) decided to fucking try the Germans in a distasteful manner in an already tense day. Think twice about what you do outside your bubble."
"I'm a huge supporter of BLM, but what I've come too realise is that some loudest people on the internet are the far reachers and easily ""triggered""  people of every movement there's ever been. They usually seem the loudest because outrageous statements get the most traffic, especially from the people who hate that certain movement and want any excuse to rip it a new one."
"Damn it, your political system is messed up, but not as messed up as what happens in the eastern Europe. My country for instance is in a constant political chrisys. Ukraine is a shitshow, Romania has less problems but also everything is shit. So yeah, we live in a world of crappy politicians, that care only about money and power."
Weird to call someone a Nazi while simultaneously acting like a brown shirt.
"Philando was a suspected armed robber, linked to the crips, had prior arrests, was on narcotics, and did not comply seeing as the officer told him multiple times to stop reaching. I'm sorry he had to die, but I think it was justified. You have no idea about police work."
"Deray ""Oh snippity snap snap snap. That monkey has a vest similar to mine! Thats clearly me!""Tariq ""Oh good lordy that vest looks kind of like derays! They are attacking blm!""Their fans ""yeah that's right ain't nobody ever wear a shitty vest before him!""Then we have the antifa idiots and Donald trump Jr being a idiot.Idiots everywhere."

"The police were way too soft on those ""protesters"" rioting."
"That YouTube story was so disturbing. I feel pity for any person who went out of there way to hurt those journalists. What did they hope would happen? That people who were watching would look at that and say to themselves ""Yeah, now THAT is cause I wanna believe in."" More people will talk about the violence that occurred, which will completely diminish the protest done by individuals who sought for peaceful resolution."
"If someone came after me, punched me, and insulted for seemingly no reason, they're getting laid out hard on the concrete."
FUCK TRIGGERED BLM CRYBABY SNOWFLAKES
one single vest wearer? coincidence? stands out like sore thumb for a purpose.  executives and directors want controversy. your talking about it is a free ad for them.  Passion of the Christ to brutal? Gave Mel about a billion extra dollars on that controversy.
I wonder why BLM is still obsessed with comparing blacks with monkeys?
"I'm sorry, did Philip DeFranco just say antifa was over extending while at the same time saying people think Lauren Southern, Tim Pool, Luke, and other youtubers are Nazis without saying there isn't proof of them being nazis? That's some CNN bullshit right there.

Poor antifa is over extending because they didn't know that Lauren Southern is a nazi. Fucking well done, Phil."
FUCK ANTIFA
Bastard's a mean name to call us that
secret link?
Lst week I bought the SPORTS! Tshirt
A black man making a racist comment about blacks. 2017 everybody!
"And u should'nt be calling them  beautiful bastards,call them TeamPDsquad"
"Compared to antifa, BLM is almost benign.

Antifa is bordering on a terrorist organization. Resolving issues with violence, intolerance and fear? That is damn well near terrorism.
But they don't care because they believe their cause is worth it.

Guessing they never heard the saying ""the path to hell is paved with good intentions"" or ‚ÄúBeware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster... for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you.‚Äù

The world needs peace, diplomacy and discussion."
"as much as morally a peaceful protest is the best course of action, practically I have to argue that it is not. Sure it is morally better to protest peacefully, but if those G20 protests had been strictly peaceful would they have been covered on the PDS? They would have been considered a non story and ignored. Black people didn't earn their rights by peaceful means, neither did women, because governments simply don't care about anything that doesnt threaten them"
The Trump Jr story is amazing. The lack of self awareness is what really gets me. They were going after Clinton over her emails. Didn't they have any sense at all that communicating via email might be a bad idea?
Trump Jr couldn't stick his foot farther up his mouth if he tried. It's clear the apple didn't fall far from the tree with this one.
"Goddammit, Im tired of this bullshit.
Either show me the proof that the election outcome was affected or STFU and move on already.
Theres way more important shit going on in this country besides whining about the outcome. 
Jesus. Its fucking July already, and no one can get anything done because they wont STFU about something they cant seem to prove."
I hate this double standard with Democrats and Republicans whenever someone makes a mistake they always look at one side and never the other
People really seem to want to hurt nazis. Too bad there are only a hand full on earth and they have no power.
Its basically treason
"Youtube ""reporter"" Lauren Southern lol"
"PHILLIP DEFRANCO,ME AND BESTENZO 25  HATE U,U PUT DADDYOFIVE'S KIDS IN DANGER AND U CAUSED HIS VIDEOS TO BE DELETED,THAT WAS MY FAVORITE YOUTUBE,AND U MADE HIM LOSE CODY AND EMMA,KEEP MESSING AROUND WITH HIM,I DARE U!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
if Trump Jr violated the law for accepting information from the Russian government because it's illegal to accept something from a foreign government during a campaign election they wanted Hillary Clinton be the same blame because she accepted millions of dollars from foreign countries
"southern and her crew do have a record of trawling left wing protests for the dumbest people they can find and conflating them with he entire left , they should have known better , they where obviously going to be seen as alt right provocateurs and targeted . theyve shown a complete disregard for interviewing well meaning lucid protesters with valid grievances in favour of finding the worst most unprepared fools they could  and ambushing them with loaded questions around a premeditated agenda . thats how shit is on the ground, they do not care about the welfare of propagandists and their bullshit , its not smart trolling a 55k crowd they got what they deserved for being stupid as fuck , i hope they enjoyed their time in hell xD"
"those people exist inside echo chambers in which this violent outlash at those they consider an enemy is praised within. so to these people, they did the right thing and they don't grasp the negative effects to their cause because they block out most nagativity, and what gets through is brushed aside as hate from intolerant haters. it's fucking stupid."
"So basically the left is mad that somebody was trying to expose their candidate for the lying, corrupt, piece of dog shit that she is?"
"blacks have it bad in america, yet they can do no wrong?"
"he certainly owns blue jackets, i think what you meant to say was, he doesn't have a monopoly on blue jackets ;)"
In regards to the BLM movement story. The movement's motivation can be perceived in a positive manner but the infestation of the movement with ultra lefties (Antifa essentially) has unfortunately delegitimized the movement (I support BLM only when the outrage is justified and result is a peaceful protest). The lack of leadership has severely affected the movement as well and has given rise to folks like Tariq and Deray who just want to profit off these incident and create fake outrage that hurts the movement as a result and give critics more ammo to hurt the legitimacy of the movement. BLM has a legitimate cause but it is crumbling under the effect of ultra lefties and the lack of a real leader has strayed the movement as well.
Planet of the apes racists??? No your an idiot with too much time on your hands. Get off internet moron.
NooOoOoo!!! What happened to the secret link of the day =[
It's pronounced DEE-ray.
it makes me sad that once charlie puth started getting big he erased all of his old youtube videos. He wanted his image to evolve but he's always going to be that kid making youtube videos and doing live streams in his dorm room to me.
"Okay first and foremost, As a fellow black person, I'll have to say this to Deray McKesson, and I'll say this out of the most kind and brotherly respect.

WHAT THE FUCK? Really nigga? Nobody but you associated the apes of Planet of the Apes as Black people.  I swear to god, this is that Clemson  University Harambe meme ban all over again. I sometimes question the sanity of humanity."
but hold on if the law says that there cannot be any money or donations during a campaign then why did Hillary accept millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and foreign countries isn't this a double standard
"OMG !

Ape with a Vest is now a black person,so blacks think they are Ape's ? WHAT !!!!! 

I know some educated blacks and they are ashamed of the average black person as they are brainwashed,easily manipulated ,thats why the BLM movement took off !"
"Germans calling people Nazis...üòï 
its like they forgot or something..."
ANTIFA is a domestic terrorist group and should be treated as such. BLM are not the that extent unless you count the narrative that they want to kill all cops but I want to hope that's only a niche group of intolerant racists.
Dont disrespect PSY though Phil
"Fuck Anti-FA, they are literally acting like fascists.  Threaten, censor and carry out violence against people who you don't agree with.  That sounds like a Nazi's behavior if you asked me.  Classic case of becoming what you hate."
5:28 You spelled Jimmy Kimmel wrong. LOL
"I am someone who has an unbelievably high amount of physical strength at my disposal and I am trained and always have trained how to use it correctly. So I am trying not to sound boastful as I am sure this will come out boastful that is not my intention, I am trying to explain to anyone who reads this that I have experience and even someone who fights even day does not believe violence is the answer. I have no intentions of bragging as I said I simply want anyone who is reading this to know that even I, someone who fights everyday believes that violence is not the answer. I want you to understand that regardless of how powerful you are or how good of a fighter you are, it does not make you any better of a human nor make you any more important than another person, your actions towards others is what dictates your value and worth in this world. Violence is never the answer, it never has been and never will be. The only time violence should occur is in self defense, when you or someone you care about is in danger, other than that it is not to be used other than if you are using it for sport. The moment you hurt someone physically that is the moment your argument loses. If you go and hurt someone by, lets say punching them in the face. The moment you do that is the moment your argument loses as the other person you are talking with never resorted to violence, they are using their brain to come up with reasons why their idea is better than yours and you need to do the same. If you hurt someone because they do not agree with you or you do not like what they are saying that shows everyone that you 1. do not have the comprehension to understand another person's point of view and/or 2. your brain does not hold the capacity to rebuttal an argument without resorting to violence. The person you are having an argument with is using words to strike your ideals on the topic down and you are normally doing the same to their ideals now if you use violence as I stated earlier it shows others that you cannot come up with a better argument than the argument they are using so you resort to violence and as I said earlier you resorted to violence because either you could not comprehend what they where saying or see any other view than yours or  you do not have the brain capacity to win your argument with the words just like they are trying to do so you resort to violence. It does not take much brain usage to hit someone but coming up with reasons why your ideals are a better route to go opposed to their ideals does take brain usage. I hope this explained it a bit, have a good day everyone and thanks for reading the comment. I hope it enlightened some of you on a couple reasons why violence is not a resort other than self defense."
so sick of trump news...can we talk about anything new
Given how much attention the media gives Trump over 2 scoops of ice cream while others only got 1 or of a freaking gif/meme he tweeted I can't take them serious even if its of something deserving of attention.
"Sometimes I like Phil's point of view, but Does it really matter? What happens if I tune out altogether? Why should I care who has the #1 video on youtube? Creating content based on our abstractions making more distractions. To get all important likes, views, subscription and $. Isn't that how the mass media end up appealing to the lowest common denominator? It's a fine channel but What the Fuck am I doing here?"
"Black people have created nothing and so attempt to steal from other races, for example ""Ancent Egyptians were black"", dreadlocks and blue jackets."
"I think this perfectly represents that Planet of the Apes black story: 
""I love humans.¬†Always seeing¬†patterns¬†in things that¬†aren't there""- The Doctor."
That Russian attorney is extremely attractive..
"Considering the results of recent US-Russian cooperation [Syrian ceasefire, anyone?], I can't believe people are still trying to drag everyone close to Trump through the mud.

There were no ""donations or contributions"", and neither party to the meeting was representing a state at the time. Two ancillary characters met and discussed Russian adoptions.
The fact his testimony included ""none that I can recall at this time"" is seen as some as a cop-out to cover his ass, but the reality is that campaign season is an INSANE time for these people.

I meet a dozen or so people each day in my line of work, and it would be impossible [for me, anyway] to keep track of them all. That wouldn't make me a liar if I stated ""I've never met John Smith, to my recollection."" It is simply an example of imperfect memory.

That said, I'm sure Trump Jr's kicking himself for answerimg the questions with ""none that were set up"" now that he's re-reading emails from the time. =p"
It's a shame Phil didn't mention more about antifa at the g20: the biggest black bloc ever and the sheer extent of damage done e.g. a whole car park of cars burnt.
christian slater was a cuck ! You .......doubly so !
Fuck Antifa. Cowards. Only brave when they have numbers. Go watch TYT and and go fuck yourselves.
"I love your show Phil, even when I disagree it always comes from a place of respect. But God damn dude, defending Identitarians who are actual Nazi's and white separatists is disappointing. Especially your softball response that we should fight them with words. my ancestors didn't fight and die on the shores of Normandy to protect some Nazi bimbo. Fuck Lauren Southern and fuck White Nationalists of all types."
"Left vs. Right - Hillary vs. Trump....? 
uhmmm thats not a right comparison, because Hillary isnt left at all. The only politician being slightly left is Sanders, who got screwed over by his own party. Hillary is on a economical spectrum on the same side as Trump. Absolutely capitalistic."
I am just too tired to hate Trump any more.
hey what up Phil Defranco
The left will continue to make fools of themselves and try to make something out of nothing...
AM I BLIND OR IS THE SECRET LINK MISSING??
didn't know what identitarian was so I looked it up and the scum deserve it
"Cool, Antifa was crazy again. IDK why these are still stories. If anything these kinds of stories should be just passing comments for the next few times they occur. I'm just so sick of hearing ""Antifa hurt man. Argument now hurt too. U guys r dumb."" It feels like if someone keeps talking about his brand new fast car that just keeps surprising him. The stories are important, sure, but they're not nearly as entertaining as they were 10 months ago."
"I dont like conservatism, I dont like the right in general. In fact I don't like centrism or these slightly left of center people... but i guess we shouldn't kill them."
.... We all know the Clinton campaign dug for dirt... fuck outta here.
*Maine lobster
"Wasn't it the left who didn't care about what was in Hillary's emails, they were more focused on the fact the emails were released? So why are they so concerned about what was in Trump Jr's emails, wouldn't caring about one but not the other be hypocritical.?.?.?"
"I'm not gonna lie, but if I was Russia I'd be getting pretty pissed off that everyday you have Americans going after you claiming shit they have very little to no evidence of. I don't understand why Americans are so annoyed they got to learn somethings about Clinton ext as it only gave them a better insight to whats going on behind the scenes of someone who was potentially going to be their President! I can't picture people being mad here if Theresa May got hacked (by anyone, source doesn't matter) and similar leaks came out due to the fact people should want to know this stuff. 
Also, the DNC should've improved their security and none of this would've happened"
How about we compromise and throw both Jr and Hillary in Prison?
#MakePsyGreatAgain
Wait waaaaat?
"""peaceful protests"""
"I see a decent amount of people pointing out and making the argument that peaceful protests and MLK's general method aren't effective because violence has been used against peaceful protesters before. This is horrible, and should never happen. However, it is also the most powerful statement you could make towards your cause when you remain peaceful even when you're violently provoked. It proves your point more than anything! The more you shove back and destroy things, the more leeway you give for people on the other side to think there's a good reason you were treated unfairly.
I cannot expect anyone to have the level of discipline even close to that of MLK or Mahatma Gandhi, but to treat the methods of the men who actually made a change as ineffective is silly. These are people you should aspire to be like; no one has ever given another a change of mind by being violent and destructive. You might have perfectly good reasoning to be mad, but please know that acting upon that anger is more than likely working against you."
"It amazes me that people are saying collusion with Russia is a criminal act. It is NOT illegal, but it is immoral. Conspiracy to commit is illegal and I think Manafort and Kashmir will take a big hit for this (possibly federal charges). That being said, and as much as I don't like him, I think this will minimally affect Donald Trump, Sr. First, I doubt his ego will have allowed him to take interest since I don't believe his name was mentioned (I haven't read all the emails, so if it was I'm unaware of it). Second, I think Donald Trump would've tweeted it or find some other way to spill the beans since I believe he's terrible at keeping secrets. Therefore, I find it plausible that he WAS unaware of any secret met tings during his campaign. I DO think obstruction of justice will be what eventually takes the President down, though, since he was probably trying to protect his son-in-law from Comey's investigation which I feel was why Comey was fired"
maybe the leader of ISIS dying is a much better video headline than a fucking email.
Getting info from the russian government isnt illegal particularly if you plan to release the information to the authorities. It would be illegal if you give the russian government sensitive info or you work with the russians to hack the DNC.
More Russian fear mongering. When will it end?
spelling error on maine* lobster link
"YouTube thinks that because I watch Philip Defranco I'm going to watch a video by The White Rose called ""The Lefts Push For Pedophile Acceptance."" It's right here in the suggested videos...Wow."
As a black man that doesn't not support blm. Fuck all the people that pit all black people in one group. We have normal Americans in our group as well.
"bring back the ""Hey, that's not cool"" section!!!"
the fuck does identitarian mean in this storie?
Phil I love your videos but I wish you would cover more Canadian stories!! British Columbia is in a state of an emergency because of wide spread forest fires throughout the province. People have lost their homes and a number of cities have been evacuated. I know this is an American show but a story this big is something that should be covered. You have a great news show but I feel it's a little Americancentric. :(

could i ask u too look at Caleb Leveretts channel and his situation get his message out and get him some help
no secret link ?!
The last story is such a non story. stop talking about it. it dosent affect us in a significant. Cover other stories for god sake. theres som many other things to report on than donald fucking trump jr
"What the fuck dude, do they really believe Tim Pool is a Nationalist? Like, they do know he's a Korean American who has stated many times he is a Liberal. God the Far-Left is getting out of control, it's fucking ridiculous."
"The G20 story reminds me of a quote I heard by Samuel Coleridge- ""I have seen gross intolerance shown in support of tolerance."" Don't know who this Coleridge guy is but man if that quote doesn't speak the truth."
Tariq Nasheed and Deray McKesson... butt fucking each other since 2014.
"Just because a group says they're Antifascist doesn't mean that they're automatically good people. Many totalitarians are Antifascist. Antifa is pro censorship and hatred; they destroy other peoples' property and incite violence openly, decrying the establishment's of capitalism while posting on twitter with their capitalist-purchased and created iphones. Their ethics are bullshit and i'd assume the majority of them are also just bullshit people who value no one else's existence but other party members - and even then we clearly see them hitting each other around like mindless fucking idiots.

Fuck Antifa."
TLDR everything is shit and the only solution is a moon sized meteor >.>
"Just so you know Phil, I think it's pronounce DEE Ray"
The story about targeting individuals in the G20 protests reminds me so much of the recent movie The Circle.
stop saying let's just jump into it
"We have anti-globalism protests in America too. We call our latest one ""President Trump""."
What the fuck?
Democratic Party is a Hate Group !
the meeting with the laywer was 2 months after the election so if its even a law it doesn't apply here
How is that Trump Jr. thing even close to illegal? Seems perfectly fine and acceptable to me. He was trying to expose corruption but apparently that's evil now.
Kekistani are always oppresed
You don't have anything in this fight? lol you're the anti trump wet dream üòÇ
well said franko
Liberals are all going to hell.
i think the other thing is information
Violent protesters? You mean riots. If only the police would open fire on violent riots. Then your riot problem would be solved and you would have way less riots because of it.
black people are the only ones comparing black people to apes
BLM conveniently ignores statistics. It's a flawed movement and I never have nor ever will support it. They cry wolf.

"Both Trump and Hilary are corrupt pieces of shit...and I think its sad that these were the two choices we had that actually had a chance at winning. Why did we get the two worst possible candidates? Because this is what the parties wanted to give us. We clearly had better candidates, but the corrupt parties didn't want better. They wanted these two for their own personal agendas."

There's never gonna be any evidence presented that the Russians hacked us or that Trump was working with them. Yeah we all understand the Russians probably did it even with no proof at all. Ok. Great. Happy days. Either way we where gonna get a jagoff in the White House. Lets move the fuck on now. The media is so god damn obsessed with its war on Trump. STFU already."
"ANTIFA is a terrorist group and should be treated as such. they seek to assault and injure innocent people after dehumanizing by falsely labeling them as fascists and Nazi's. anyone who supports them is incapable of having civil discussion and of anyone has tried to talk to them, they can attest to that."

I'm too stupid to understand the last part of the vid lmao
Why are people so upset about Trump Jr. everyone in politics lies because they have to try and please everyone which is impossible. Also Trump won so people need to get over it and stop dragging people through the mud about something they said months ago. Get over it.
I have to draw a line at being peaceful with Nazis phil. if we treated Nazis as a rational ideal and politely the world today would be in a much worse place. Nazis lost their right to peace when their ideals call for the eradication of entire peoples

It's not right, but it is common sense."
This G20 story confused the hell out of me
What I find scary with the Russian-Trump thing is the fact that the Government Lawyers who wrote the law didn't add the word 'monetary' before the word 'value'. Almost anything can be argued to have value.

"i live not to far from where philando castile was killed. and more information has been released, philando was not supposed to have a firearm. he had a aggravated assault record, he was supposed to let the state that issued his carry permit, know that he had an aggravated assault on his record, so that his carry permit could be revoked. and two, he was higher than a fucking kite. he probably though in his head he was grabbing his wallet but in reality, it was the gun"
People don't really speak about the DNC messing with their own contry's election. Just the Russia non-news. Weird....
"Phil, please report on the ""Parents Explain Masterbation"" to their children video. Its trending right now and its disgusting. Youtube will monetize that video teaching little girls about dildos but they wont monetize your actual reporting on current events? Something is seriously wrong with Youtube."

"If you don't support BLM because someone said something real dumb about a movie and a vest then that's also real dumb. Whether you do or do not support BLM, let's all get more serious about how we formulate our opinions mmkay (Also since when is any movement about equal treatment/opportunity for black communities the same as BLM, last time i checked there is a ton of different organizations and movements about issues like these, different approaches and ideas too, let's all do our research #whenthecommentsectionstartsgettingtoyou )"
glad I got to watch this before Tariq Nasheed flags it
"Believe it or not Charlie Puth was originally banned from YouTube for copyrights strikes many years ago. Now on his newer channel he posts music videos one of which has a lot of sexually suggestive content that would get other peoples videos demonetized, harder to find when searching  and or removed all together, while he gets away with it scott free. Got love them double standards."
I just want to say why would you call your kid trump jr ?
No secret link?
Please cover Omar Khadr and his recent payout by Canadian gov! It is the biggest story in Canada right now and would like to hear your opinion!
The best part is Deray got the idea from Tariq Nasheed
the racist comments are at an all-time high on this video
I dont know why but i laughed at G20 not that i dont know or like but if this happens in USA they call the RIOT unit thats like 500 to 1000 in most cases but germany is stright up savage instead of riot they call up the SWAT team lol or SEK
Antifa is cancer
"Beautiful video, Phil.  Gonna break down my three beats for the video.

1.) I can understand how the likeness could have been misconstrued to be illustrating said person as an ape, but ultimately it does also seem like a bit of a reach.  That being said, a message from the creators can and should easily clear that up, maybe acknowledging that the similarity exists but explaining that it's a throwback to the original (which it clearly is).
2.)  I support anti-fascist sentiment; fascism is a real threat to any capitalist democracy, and it's an easy thing for a country to fall into without even being aware, World War 2 Germany being a perfect example of this.  However, the modern ""AntiFa"" movement is exceedingly radical and violent.  I'm not saying that fascists are not exceedingly violent; hell, in specific circumstances I could see where force is required to deal with people wishing to inflict harm on others; however, it's clear that this was not one of those situations, and instead of stalking and attacking these people, they could have EASILY organized a non-violent ""shame"" chant or something similar if they really viewed these people as representatives of a clashing viewpoint.  Not that that'd be the right course of action, but it'd be more correct than stalking and attacking them, which is just wrong.
3.) Finally, my whole issue with this entire cascade of events with the Trump campaign is the nepotism and corruption that is widespread throughout his time campaigning and even currently.  Some say it's natural for a son to want to help his father win the presidency, and while I can understand that, the most ethical, safe way to practice politics in the united states is honestly for family members to do NOTHING except maybe minor things such as phone banking and rally organization during a campaign, and not to claim representation or surrogacy for the president whilst overseas with them.  I took issue with this when First Lady Obama carried out several meetings with foreign diplomats; she used the title of First Lady to represent the country when she, herself, wasn't an elected official.  The same can be said of Donald Jr in this issue, and with Ivanka having sat in America's seat at the G20 meetings.  It doesn't matter the intent, these people aren't elected officials, they were not chosen by the American public to represent us, and it's simply improper.  Is it grounds to impeach?  Not in Ivanka's case and maybe not even in Don Jr's.  However, if I were Mr. Trump Jr., I would be looking for an IMMACULATE attorney, because even if he isn't guilty of any of the charges being levied against him, the arguments can definitely be made, and one wrong move at this point could implicate him further.

I'm really happy with how you covered these matters, Phil; you did an excellent job of illustrating reasonably balanced point for each segment, and of course the awesome stuff is awesome.  Well done."
hillary took millions from saudi so where is the talk on that???
"solicotation is initiation, so no argument can be made that Trump Jr. was the soliciting party. Further, info (words) are protected speech in this context, see foreign media as an example for why that segment of US code cannot be deployed against information."
"Other thing of value is monetary value...come on, being slimy isn't illegal."

Republicunts are ok with treason as long as it helps a criminal win the election
"I remember back in the day when every youtuber had their intro done by Charlie Puth or whenever someone made a song, even if it was comedy or a parody, Puth often helped put it together. He grinded on YouTube for a long time building up his musical skill so to now see him collab with big names and have his own music that plays on the radio is super cool. Proud of him :)"
"Apparenly if¬†lefties go to Trump rallys with provocative t-shirts they deserve the violence they get, But right wingers do the same¬†it's 'free speech' ¬†Hint No violence is ok . but the double standard on the right needs to be pointed out."
"As far as I'm concerned Trump Jr. made a dumb move, thats as much as I can tell from what's been shown. But again this whole issue hinges on that the Russians hacked the DNC servers which is the original point and to this day we do not know that is true we can only draw conjectures that this is true.

We do know that for the last 15 years at least the Russians have been consistently hacking and before that they were doing mail fraud and so on so to that I ask what is the point?"

where is the meat!?! it was all a nothing burger .... don jr is now cleared
Why do some black people love being victims? It's embarrassing the rest of us sane blacks.
who the fuck is deray? fuck off
Tariq Nasheed IS a racially coded message...
"I honestly don't see what Donald Trump Jr. Did as treason (Like some are saying). No one said the Trumps are geniuses but honestly he really didn't do anything that hasn't been done before. Every Election you have Presidential Candidates looking for dirt on their opponents, so you can win. It happened with Bush Sr.'s Campaign, it happened With Clinton's, it Happened with Gerorge W's, it happened with Obama's, and now it happened with Trump's. Hell, it even happened during JFK's and Lincoln's. I feel like people are only freaking out because it's Trump, and people like complaining about it."
....And then they cry and moan when people say they're always looking for racism where there is none.
please talk about the Paedophilia as a sexual orientation!!!! LGBTP????????
"Phil, the song isn't that good, they obviously bought Chinese bots for views ..."
"thank god, no cops shooting innocent dogs today"

"The entire Russian investigation is a ""Nothing Burger"""
"Trump is the president, and for whatever reason, why can't the sore losers of last year deal with it?"
Do you ever not just jump into it? Or do you just like dumb repetitive intros?
"thats the point they want to their on cause , antifa got paid to hurt conservative journalist then journalist people act as the critic"
"Deray doesn't own blue vests, but he is known for the blue vests. I understand why he'd be upset."
"I repeat what I said months ago: We would not be having these issues if runners for political office could not campaign or receive donations when under investigation by any sector of the United States. (any attempt to do so should disqualify them from the election)
Trump was under court issues for his university. Hillary for the emails. Both would have been out of the campaign for months.

If we have states where former criminals can't vote, we should have laws against our potential politicians - our representatives who are endowed with great trust and responsibility - being under investigation for criminal activity."
"Going out of the way of the Lauren Southern thing, the real issue is how the NoG20 Protests were handled and organized. First, you have to understand that the City of Hamburg is a very liberal & left-leaning city, the reigning party is the SPD (Social-Democratic Party) and it has been for the last decades. Due to Hamburgs enormous financial success it is political 'crown jewel' if you will & was chosen for the G20 for exactly the same reason. And, for the vast majorty of 'Hamburger' - as the people of Hamburg are called - this was a really shitty deal. They knew that their city, especially the 'Schanzenviertel'-District would be everything but in favor of this situation. The 'Schanzenviertel' is left-wing overall, but the 'Rote Flora', a Theatre occupied by a group of Left-wing autonomous group is - as the name says - far on the left wing of the left wing. The SPD (don't let the name fool you by the way, they're centrists at best) wanted to show some lenience and basically 'allowed' this to happen. And, since its an autonomous group, they ofcourse have ties to the antifa, which became more and more militant over the years.

But this wasn't the biggest issue. Right now, the Mayor of Hamburg is under heavy fire from every side, even the police chief - normally a very formal person - called for his resignation. He, the mayor, was in charge of the preperation of the G20 & the handling of the protests - and a couple of months ago he compared the G20 & the anticipated riots (yes, these riots were anticipated by experts) with our annual city fair, the 'Harbour Birthday'. He handled the preperation piss poorly and when the riots started, he sat in our newly build concert hall and listened to classical music while parts of the city were literally on fire. 

And the second big part was played by the organizers of the 'Welcome to Hell'-G20 ""Protest"". This was organized by the 'Rote Flora', this autonomous group & their public figures; A. Beuth & A. Blechschmidt. Now, the protest/demonstration was ofcourse allowed by the Mayor since Demonstrations are protected by the German Constitution. The issue is, that Beuth & Blechschmidt publicly - in media & social media - called for heavy actions. They called for burning down cars, throwing stones & general destruction to cause disturbances of the G20-summit & produce enough destruction so that the costs would be so high, that holding another G20 summit in a major city would be unattractive to politicians. After Friday, when the SEK (a special police commando unit) was called, due to the prep. & possible use of Molotov cocktails by the Black Bloc, the severe use of Water Cannons, massive incarcerations & the riots dying down bit by bit, Beuth told a local TV station, that - and i quote: ""As an autonomous left-winger i'm actually in favor if these actions, but please not in our district. Go to P√∂seldorf or Blankenese and do it there but not where we live (Blankenese & P√∂seldorf are 'rich' districts). 
The Public outrage was, of course, severe. Not only were people outraged by this statement but also about the callous reply to be 'ok' with burning down cars of single mothers, Transport cars of physically challenged people etc. These two fuckwits opened Pandorra's Box in the hopes to cause so much damage & when the evil released from the box destroyed everything, they were in shock that it would be that bad - they invited the Black Bloc & the Antifa and both came.

The Good part is, that the 'Rote Flora"" is now very close of being evicted, Beuth & Blechschmidt are publicly shunned & will face criminal charges due to harbouring & protecting 'terrorists' & our inept mayor will not be elected again - but he won't considering stepping down. The clear winner is Merkel & the CDU (Christian Democratic Union), 2 Months before our General Elections her instant action to provide compensations for all who have suffered damage to their property will gain her votes. The loser are the people - once again.

As for Lauren Southern & other Conservative Youtubers - even though i do not agree with much if at all anything she says, i'm sincerely sorry for what happened to her & her collegues."
"That Soren guy was an actual accredited reporter and he did a lot more than take a simple photo that others took out of context. He called all of them, Loren, Tim Pool and the 2 who were beaten alt right and sent their photos and details to Antifa boards telling them ""You know what to do!"" See Tim Pools and the Heavy.com videos."
"Charlie Puth as an artist is generic mainstream garbage, at least Psy was charismatic and entertaining."
"I'm gonna disagree with you Phil, on the Russia story. No politician would pass up information on their opponent. Hillary or anyone else would have jumped on such an offer. Don't think it's immoral or wrong, everyone desires truth."
Germans are all fucked up in the heads.They like to take it to extreme whether left or right.
Maybe if they'd stop acting up like apes their movement would get more respect. All lives matter.

We've been living on the road for about five days now, anxiously waiting to hear if we will have a home to return to when all of this craziness is over. I just got some wifi to tune in to your show Phil and I wanna just say how thankful I am to you doing this show. In this time of panic, sitting down and catching up on your shows for the past couple of days has given me a sliver of normalcy. Love what you do here and truly admire it üòäüá®üá¶‚úåüèª"
"didn't he just make a mistake because he was misinformed I don't think that has something to do with BLM as he isn't BLM, he's a human and he made a mistake. It's not that deep."
Fuck BLM.

IT's no longer a protest when violence erupts! It becomes a riot!
The Phillip Defranco political show. 5 minutes droning on about the Trump Jr almost real scandal that we all heard about already...CNN hasn't shut up about it we don't need this shit from you now as well. Still love you though. XOXO
they dont even know what they are there for so the cause being hurt doesn't matter to these ppl they protest cus they think it's trendy  maybe if they get a life they would not hurt things they dont care about
"Hey Phil, why are you calling the people who are rioting ""protesters""?"
"Just some feedback, I would have loved some background on the Identitarian party, since I was not aware of the movement until I paused the video to do research. Love the show, love what you do, keep it up!"
"This is so hypocritical it's sad. It's ok for Hillary to receive funds for her campaign from a foreign country. But it's not ok to not receive any information from a foreigner. In my eyes Donald jr. was in the wrong, but so was Hillary. The question is, did trump have anything to do with it? Our government is so fucked up. You can't believe anything. They're all criminals hiding behind their money."

"Blackkk lives matter, especially when they are brandishing a weapon and disobeying police orders"
"I understand that Deray reacting to the war of the planet of the apes billboard is considered a reach, But i'm not sure if you understand the negative impact the media had (still has) when it comes to the perception of black people. I would agree that Deray is being triggered by something that is most likely not directed at black people, but I also believe covert racism exist on a daily basis (especially in America). I also don't think this discredits the movement itself, I think the media is already doing that. 

And for everyone trying to equate BLM to isis...BLM does not recruit members online promising them heaven if they blow themselves up, or run a van through public venues. They do not take women and force them into marriage, they do not chop peoples....why am I even bothering with this, most of you are probably prepubescent trolls. 

Have A NIce."
"Yeah, they should have laundered the contributions by foreign governments through charities, like the Clintons did."
"As for Small Trump, what Hillary did was fucking wrong, what he was doing/trying to do was fucking wrong!! Just because your opposition did it does not mean you have the right to do it, he's a colossal dickwaffle who tried to pass the child's argument that just because a sibling did it first that they can get off scott-free, but given his Father, that's not surprising. Clinton and Trumps teams seem so alike in actions I'm surprised a coalition wasn't considered, the Americans really were stuck between a rock and a shitty place"
"Hey Phil, have you thought about adding time stamps in the description, so it's easier to navigate or chose what story/content we wanna watch?"

"Would someone mind kindly explaining what identitarians are? I searched it up and apperantly it has something to do with folks wanting to keep identity as a priority, even if that identity is as a racist or etc, but I'm still a tad unsure"
"The problem with your logic about Antifags is that they only exist to make their points with violence. They are a legitimate terrorist organization. Especially in Europe where they actually shoot, blow up and kill rival protestors and politicians.
The most disgusting part about that whole story is the supposed ""journalist"" that actually singled out those random people, lied about their politics and essentially put out a hit on them. But will he lose his job or receive any condemnation from his own side ? Pfft, yeah right."
"Trump Jr won't get arrested or tried for breaking that law, just watch."
"""people"" aren't freaking out as much as the media"
"I'm a Trump supporter and I usually agree with him( not always), but I do know he is a puppet. Every president since the Civil War has been corrupt. And almost every candidate (some are good) that get to the finals are bad."
"i personally think its easiest for people to jump to the first conclusion they can come up with, rather than to think a whole situation through in order to see that most things are horribly subjective. its the getting over our selves part that we struggle with which makes us perpetuate what we ultimately hate and lands us in a melting pot state."

"As a Black man, I have to say... come on Deray... Planet of the Apes is not about us; stop jumping at shadows.  If you look at what color gorillas are, guess what!  They're black, brown or silver!  But that doesn't mean they are us.  Yes, it has been used a slur before, but, not every gorilla in a movie or the world represents us.  Does that mean that zoos are racist cause they have gorillas and are 'depicting' black folks need to be caged?  Stop it foo'!  It distracts from the very real public perceptions of us."
"Because the left is soooooo desperate to find anything ,, Anything that can de legitimize Trumps presidency .. They are foaming at the mouth"
"The whole BLM thing has gotten way out of hand. I get it, you're trying to stop racism against black people. I appreciate it, being black myself. But THIS kind of thing is why the movement is considered a joke among people. They're just looking for  things like this to call people out without doing any research beforehand. It only takes a minute to google ""Planet of the Apes blue vest"" to see that maybe, JUST MAYBE, wearing a blue vest was in the franchise before that fucker ever tweeted about it."
Black live matter is a cause?
"Left: it's illegal, Russia!
Right: it's not illegal, Hillary! JFC we can't agree on shit. There is only ONE winner here, Russia. Wall we are bizzy fighting ourselves, Russia is becoming more powerful.

They're Antifa. All Antifa are retarded terrorists.
"I understand that Phil wants to present both sides to a story, but sometimes it can be very confusing as it really does a disservice to the overall picture.  While in the effort of presenting both sides of the foreign government influencing issue, I think I larger point is lost - in that one is a member of the presidential family, and the other is the loser.  Granted yes, illegal is illegal, and both sides need to be properly investigated, but I think it should be prioritized as our current President and his family, associates and others have been continually been caught lying.  Yeah, lets investigate Hilary, but can we focus on the more important part of the two for now?  Phil really does not do a good job of framing the importance of what is happening, by equating something the current sitting president is doing/has done with what currently a private citizen is doing/has done.  Regardless of party, the President should always be held to a higher standard.

Again, don't get me wrong, we should definitely look into the loser's misdoings, but maybe after we finished whats more important first?  In that way of thinking, Phil, can you try to frame your stories like this a little better?  By not, I feel the larger issue is being skewed."
Take an effin breath!
I think anyone who protest violently should be arrested or electrocuted ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
"The problem is you can't connect this to trump, from the info provided it only implicates trump jr. in the possible but not likely crime of improper aid for a political campaign from a foreign gov. All you can do is speculate on trumps knowledge of jrs actions, which is all the media has, and has had this whole time during this Russian collusion witch hunt. If their was any truth to Russia colluding with trump, with all the worlds media after him, it would have come to light and been proven"
Anifa can suck a bag of dicks.
Humans in this time of existence think that they has to be important and Everyone should behave like thats the truth its disgusting that they allow themselves to be distracted this way instead of Moving forward and change this world for the better
"The issue with the legal arguments (that are coming from the Left with no context) in regards to what Don Jr. did is that I believe in context, the laws that people are citing are in regards to Government employees (Senators, Congressmen, Presidents, etc etc) and this is basically so a foreign government can't influence an election and the choices elected officials will make.

Campaigns and the people who work for them are not government employees, and as Don Jr. was a private citizen, he was technically free to set-up the meeting believing he was going to receive information that could harm Hillary's presidential run."
"They're not trying to preach tolerance anymore Phil, that's so 2015."
I don't know Phil but when you are constantly looking for something in your life or your environment you tend to find what you are looking for even when it's not there. Its like when you are driving a car and you're sliding into a wall and you continue to look at the wall you are going to hit it. However if you are looking for a safe path you're most likely going to find yourself steering and heading that direction. Or simply put stop looking at the problem and start looking for the solution.
"Hey Phil - I'm not seeing a link to Lauren Southern's ""I'm sorry"" video in the description - did we mean to have one here since you mentioned it?"
It'd be interesting to see what would happen to america  if everyone stopped bitching and let the president do his job.

"I am tired of hear ""TRUMP THIS! RUSSIA THAT! LAWS BROKEN! UNETHICAL!"" I don't want to hear about it anymore because if Trump did it, so did a whole shit ton of other politicians. Right now, I feel like the left is only doing something because they want to ruin the right's chance at governing the nation. The right isn't trying to break the country. All they are doing is putting a different perspective of what they feel would better the country."
"Just a foreign government official offering information about a candidate by itself should not be cause for concern.  The actual information is the context that would make this wrong or not.  What kind of information, if it's even true, and how it is obtained are what's really important.  For example, what if they just pointed to information that was readily available from another means but had yet to be discovered?  Or what if this official had provided legitimate information that Hillary was scheming with Saudi Arabia to purposeful destabilize the middle east?  Purely hypothetical (calm down please) but I would want to know something like that regardless of where it came from."

you forgot to mention how Jared Kushner was involved in that email chain as he was CCed and because of that violated federal law as he lied on his security clearance papers....
Republicans need to force Trump to resign and then find someone that is even vaguely likeable and announce early elections. I am sure they will win against anyone the democrats can muster in a sort notice.
Making yourself out to be the victim makes you a shithead
"Yo Phil, maybe their cause doesn't just SEEM intolerant and violent? But then again I'm the kind of person that will take appropriate action by believing you if you say you will kill me."
"I find it funny that they don't see the hypocrisy in what they're doing. Nazis were intolerant and used violence, but never pretended to be tolerant. These idiots pretend to be tolerant while using physical violence to attack people with different ideals. Different scales but still, the irony is there,"

And your whole thing about it being a conversation is a load of bullshit. You only end up responding to 20 to 30 tweets each Friday, and sometimes less because of stories you missed.  Please make Friday a normal news day and simply respond in the comments rather than in a video. I seems less like you are having a conversation and more like you just want to parade the fact that you ""care about your fans""."

"Boy, I sure hope the left doesn't hurt its back doing contortions trying to twist this into something illegal."

Deray is stupid as fuck
I watch your videos while I poop.
"I hate racism but the way many bring it up is frustrating and it pisses me off. Why in their fucking mind can't they understand that when you are trying to counter someone when they are being ""racist"" you can't hate on them or resort to violence because it negates your whole argument."
I'm black and I hate fucking deray what a cunt.
Clinton lied! Send her to jail!
"5:24 Kimmy Kimmel Live is the best, I love that their name is an alliteration."
You misspelled G20 Riots in the title
WHERES MY SECRET LINK AT! lol
Ins't it amazing.. we live in a world where people who think a group of people are nazist/facist/racist are attacking them and judging  them and being what they are fighting
don't see them pulling this shit at the bikers for trump gatherings
"racism, when it's more about your clothes than the colour of your skin, well done for using race for attention"
"I might not agree with everything Lauren Southern says (though I do agree with a bunch - solid arguments, usually, though she can take it too far for me personally), but she's certainly not a nazi, and she's certainly not violent. The fact that people attack her for wearing a shirt from a youth party they disagree with, pretty much just supports her arguments."
Maine* Lobster ;)
"""As pointed out ealier donald trump jr. and the trump administration would NOT* be the only ones guilt of this."" is what you meant to say."
Gosh the BLM movement continues to make them selves look more idiotic
Lock her up!
"I see you, Phil. You put at the beginning a couple of stories that'll satisfy the right and talk about things that'll make them mad later so they don't leave early and get the extra play time. I can respect that move. Tip to everyone out there: know your audience."
Trump 2020
"In regards to the Trump Jr. fiasco, BOTH sides are in the wrong here. The legal side of things do matter, but in my mind they matter a little less than the moral implication of it. Both sides were fighting for the seat of the president, the highest office in america. It should, if it doesn't already, come with a need for a high moral standard. Both sides do not demonstrate this quality. As for what should be done, i cant say, this is way above my head to determine the effect this would have."
"Agree or disagree...? Honestly still think things you say are just common sense, and it's amazing for how many people it obviously is not, that's about it, and it always was, that said we all goof up from time to time, what's important is owning up to it (or at least try to)"
Saw my beloved Lauren and had to click her beautiful face. #NotEvenALesbianButIAmForLauren
If this is all they have on Trump they have less than a nothing burger. They are getting extremely desperate if they are pointing at this as a smoking gun.
Trump is righteous and legitimate.
"Utter NothingBurger. It's not illegal or immoral for a private citizen to seek a meeting with someone from a foreign nation. Period. That woman lawyer from Russia dangled a carrot claiming she had damaging info on Hillary, turned out she didn't, she just wanted to get a meeting in order to talk about the difficulty of Americans adopting Russians."
Fuck. The. Left.
"All activists are like this, this is why I started dispising any form of activisim as it only breeds hatred
Protests are a good thing? tell that to all the people of hamburg who lost their cars and had their properties destroyed. I am so sick of these people, selfishly threatening all others around them, and it does not stop there, all activists are the same. Be it the Antifa, Neonazi, Peta, Feminazis, all the same, throw them in a pit, give them weapons and promise the single last survivor to grant him freedom and absolution (and shoot him in the face when he emerges, there problem solved like they would love to solve all their problems)"
Why wouldn't they be freaking out about Donald Trump Junior's email dump? Anything they can find or make believable to try to impeach Trump is freak out material. Make something up and send it to them. You too can be an anonymous source.
Oh my Gods.... BLM activists have hit a new low... And I'm shocked that was possible...
Black people feeling insecure that apes are getting more spotlight than them..smh.
"Couldn't it be possible that this was a set-up from the DNC or HC campaign from the beginning? Not saying there was no wrongdoing or attempt at wrongdoing on DT Jr's part, but the way that email was worded ""our governments support of the Trump campaign"" I dunno... something doesn't seem quite right about this story."
"The Left should release damaging information on Putin. Smear him so much, he becomes the most disgraced Russian in their nation's history."
original comment: you're so vain you thought that this movie was about you
God dammit Donald Jr. is ugly
"the left needs a good ol bitch slap, the worst thing is the media almost supports them"
So those people on the social platforms that instigated violence are still allowed to use the platform... I guess saying mean things is worse then labeling someone a nazi followed with get them.
Yea no planet of the apes is not racist
"I still wounder what the end goal of this would be for people. I understand the research and seeing if wrong doing has accrued, but do you really think that's enough to get Trump Impeached? Let's say it is too, that doesn't mean Hillary, Bernie or any other candidate just gets to flying into the officer and save the day like the super hero people think they are. Not to give Trump any slack, he's an asshole, but the majority of people only care about this because it's Trump. 

The reason why people bring up ""But Hillary Did"" arguments so much is because if Hillary was in officer instead right now you know the people who think this is treason would give Hillary a pass. ""It's not that big of a deal, it happens all the time, even if it is illegal and could have skewed the election who cares!""Now Trump supporters would say this as a way to give Trump a pass when he still needs to get the punishment he deserves from it. However I say that as someone who is telling people that their all a bunch of hypocrites who would impeach Trump for littering, but wouldn't care if Hilary was dumping trash in the ocean. Keep in mind Obama said the election couldn't have been hacked and Trump needs to get over the idea that it could be, but then  it was a possibility when Trump won. And the same goes for Trump supporters if Hillary won because they would still be  reporting on the election being hacked by Hillary. You all only care for your side."
when you seek oppression or something to be offended about you will undoubtedly find it regardless of whether it exists or not
Tariq got taken off of YouTube today for making false copyright claims. LOL
i am so embarassed for being german we have and will always bring forth the dumbest people around
#Apelivesmatter
"Phill, I'm finding it harder to watch your channel. No fault of your own, but whenever I watch one of your vids YouTube immediately peppers my recommends with a bunch of Alt Right and Actual Nazi channels, and I'm dreading seeingt even the thumbnails of that crap. And let's not even talk about the comments. Whether or not its the audience you wanted, sadly it seems to be one congregating around you."
YouTube source: Kimmy Kimmel Live.
Lauren southern isn't even a nazi lol. She has never been quoted saying anything anti Semitic whatsoever.
"Find me the law called ""collusion""... I'll wait... https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text

The only time ""collusion"" is mentioned  is with respect to something illegal, in other words, something like aiding and abetting a crime."
Phili I really think your giving people to much credit of intelligence.  It seems to be a mob mentality society now.
No one ever brings up the positives of BLM.
There's no secret link link...?
Two things I can't stand. Intolerant people. And the Dutch.
"Phil, why don't you go look up the definition of Solicit?  How can you say Donald Trump Jr. Solicited this information, since he was the one being contacted?  He didn't go out of his way to find them, they aggressively pursued a meeting with him, and he went along with it.  It really is a non-troversy, the liberal media foaming at the mouth for SOMETHING to repair their damaged image."
"Antifa are terrorists and need to be crushed. Lucky for them they only pull their bullshit in liberal areas, come try that in the South pussies."
"Yes investigate both sides on collusion, but one side one the  presidency and their collusion is now more important because it can lead to further ties to foreign governments."
Trump jr looks like the guy from big time rush
"fuck it i am gonna do it.

only Black could see the abe as a black man.
because only black ppl can see the difference between black ppl.

white only see black ppl with love banana's







This was a Joke.
i think it was ok."
ugh!
Fascism in Germany...what a surprise...
"phill, it kind of seemed like you think Lauren is a Nazi"
"C'mon phil, you know an actual youtuber doesn't have the crown, it's wiz kalifa or w/e his name is that took the crown, still shitty  mainstream old media"
I love Lauren
"Why are we still going on with Hillary. She's not in the damn office, so who gives a fuck?"
"Who cares if Donald Trump Jr lied? He's not the president, his dad is. He's just some businessman. If someone in another country calls and is like ""hey we have some really bad info on your dad's opponent"" I mean, does it really matter if he took a meeting? I don't even see why that's like wrong to do. Transparency is good, if someone has damning information on a candidate, let it out! Talking to a Russian lawyer isn't a crime dude."
"Phil, you should really talk about the fact that isis lost mosul, it's capital in Iraq, and is on the verge of losing raqqa, it's capital in Syria; moreover, their leader abu bakr al-baghdadi which I believe has something to do with their ideology is presumed dead. what am trying to say this is just good news regarding the terror that is isis and hopefully they will be gone sooner than later"
"Antifa is a terrorist organization, ""Black Lives Matter"" is an anti-white racist group."
"I've noticed that you keep saying ""I had to share"" about videos on channels that belong to Group Nine, and this is happening roughly once a week. Could just be coincidence, and you do in fact legitimately like these videos and wish to pimp out their awesomeness. But there is a noticeable patter."
I want everyone to ask themselves. What came out about Hillary from the Trump Campaign that we did not already know. The answer is nothing. So nothing came from this meeting. From another angle...what campaign would realistically pass up potentially hurtful information on their opposition. None that I know of.
The shhoting was completely justified. the cop stopped him and told him not to reach for his gun. he reached for his gun and was shot. his friends that were in the car at the time confirmed this. you have been lied to @DeFranco
We aren't at war with Russia. Why do the Dems keep acting like any contact with them is necessarily evil?
God I just wanted the cocaine!
please black lives matter would call it racist if they seen a black telephone pole get the hell over it it's a fucking movie
"Chill out with your titles, also pick a different thumbnail for once. I promise it won't kill you."

"My niüÖ±üÖ±as, we need the Gestapo to sweep up this trash."
"Spit on nazis with words just like in WW2!              
Lol.         
Spit on Nazis with napalm. 
Nazi killing is as American as apple pie, of course, the real nazis nowadays are CNN and the DNC"
"I swear if Despacito becomes number one, i will be very fucking pissed."
"People are always saying, ""Well Hillary broke the law too!"" I'm as liberal as it gets and I say investigate all of em!! Clinton ain't no saint either, but I'm not sure how you can give Donny Jr. more of the benefit of the doubt here. He basically did exactly what he's been accused of, lied about it multiple times, but because he's ""new at this"" we're all supposed to forgive him and let it go? New rule, everybody who breaks the law has to actually answer for it. Starting now. Go!"
trump jr put national security at risk with these emails he should be locked up
Glad to see #ShutupTariq is still a thing.
"lul I own bkack t-shirts if he owns blue vests.
anything wearing a black piece of cloth similar to a T-shirt is racist from now on"
fuck anarchist and nazis no fuck hitler crazy fool
Wow you're blatantly a Trump supporter and it makes me laugh.
"So we're upset that Don Jr. colluded with the Russian government in an attempt to get evidence that Hillary Clinton colluded with the Russian government?

Can we get our mulligan on the election yet? I'll vote for President DeFranco any day."
"I never really understood why people are so much more offended by the exposer of dirty secrets than the dirty secrets themselves.
I mean, this huge mess surrounding Clinton, that was things SHE did. 
Why are people so mad at the ones exposing her and just ignores what she did?"
"So if Trump can't take info from Russia, how come Hillary could take contributions from Saudi Arabia?"
philandos shooting was justified ya moron. Still cant believe ur that retarded philip... glad i unsubbed from ur damn echo-chamber.
"FUCK YOU ALL

"Goes to a zoo, sees monkey. Wow, racism. Because there isnt a flaw in that"
Hey Phil it's like they named their fists Love and Tolerance. It was a weird choice but I guess it was effective?
"I'm really starting to wonder if anything in the Trump family is based on acfual facts. Or is it al just ""alternative"" facts/unashamed lies? As a European i really don't understand what's happening across the pond. You guys do realise these people are actually in office right?"
Secret link!?!?!?!?
"I¬¥d be happier about Puth beating PSY if he weren¬¥t such a shit writter. ""Let¬¥s Marvin Gaye and get it on"". Nothing about that phrase works."
Why did you say john cena but cut to a desk and a white background?
"I'm confused about the Trump Jr thing. how would it be illegal to get info from any country? The law you quoted is clearly talking about gifts... there is no question. There is this thing called ""the spirit of the law"" they are talking about bribes. even the second part of ""it specifically refers to the things in that law... It doesn't say you can't solicit at all. its just saying you cant solicit for bribes. It's pretty clearly worded and the ""spirit"" of the law is pretty clear as well.. it's saying ""you can't be bribed by someone"""
Antifa are Fucking terrorists
"-Guy is racist
-blm destroy their hometown
-guy is still racist



Whats the bigger problem?? Fuck racists but your making a bigger fucking problem than it needs to be"
"October 27th is also the release date of super Mario Odyssey
<*insert the more you know transition*>"
"For the Planet of the Apes story, this guy is fucking dumb and trying to milk bullshit out of nothing."
TrumpbJr. is selling out America
"Hurt their cause? I feel like you don't really get what Antifa is about. Its a ""If your not with me your against me""-ideology that preaches violent action. Their ""cause"" is not about peaceful discussion and things like that, this is what they do."
can you make a douchebag of the day (possibly year) about isabel Martinez?
"From what I've gathered Antifa and Black block are wayyyyy worse over in the EU, make the ones here in the US look like childs play. And way bigger, talking thousands of people in all black, hiding their faces, burning cars, looting, drinking and partying. And basically hunting anyone who doesnt agree with them. You get people talking about their cars getting burned like its just casual conversation."
Did anybody else completely forget Psy or however you spell it existed until Philip brought him up? I did.
"i really wanna support BLM (with stuff like Castille), but stuff like this makes it harder"
I remember when Charlie Puth made the intro music for the LinzLoves channel.
"Information, although of value, can't logically be used for this instance. If we are to assume the information is now included with that, this means that any information that is given by a foreign nation during a campaign would be illegal, which is ridiculous. Imagine a campaign runner looking at statistics of foreign nations to compare to our own suddenly being arrested because the information was published by that foreign government's census. And if you made the case that it's a private dealings and so that scenario doesn't count, it also opens up for a strange loophole where campaign runners can take ""publicly available"" funds from a foreign government, meaning that if you run a campaign and essentially take a ""welfare check"" from a foreign government that you use in your campaign, it would be legal."
"Fuck Nazis but also fuck communist, and left-wingers who makes false claims of Nazis."
libtards hear Russia and Trump in the same sentence and immediately assume that something horrible just happened. then it always turns out that nothing happened
"How does Deray hurt the case of Philando Castille? Was Deray involved with the shooting, just cause he tweeted about it a few times makes it hurt Philando's image...really Phil? You're reaching hard here. It's evident what you're trying to do by bringing up Philando's case in some stupid Deray comment. Now look at your comment section...nothing but alt-right & racist comments."
"some people need to be victims somehow. like anita sarkessian, it makes them good money"
"With all due respect it seems like the trump administration have really bought in to the ""bad publicity is still publicity"" stint. Every single day there is some form of news about some crazy shit that someone in the administration is getting up to. The news is so over saturated (fake or no) with trump politics that you simply can't get away from it. He is president now, and you will know about him and his people, whether you like it or not"
"Had time for only 1 youtube video today, and I picked the Philip DeFranco Show!"
lol he basically called himself a ape
I'm a big fan of planet of the apes and when I saw the vest that was the first thing I thought. It looks a lot like the old ones
That ape doesn't look like him it just a blue vest also fuck you 914 dislikes C**ts
"Thank you for speaking about the events at G20. Im of the opinion that 99.999% of politicians are criminals. Fact is they are all responsible for countless innocent lives being Taken. I don't understand why in the days of the internet where we can all represent ourselves as individuals, we still use a system that is hundreds of years outdated & broken."
"What a complete and total misinterpretation of the law that was intended to prevent foreign governments from bribing public officials.  There is no way that investigating a claim of malfeasance is taking a bribe.  Especially when the entire American intelligence apparatus under Loretta Lynch is giving Hillary a pass on anything she does.  This would be tantamount to making it so that it is illegal to investigate malfeasance by a party in power that will not investigate itself and can effectively make illegal investigations by the opposing party. That is f'ing nuts.  That does not follow the letter of the law, nor the intent of the law, and even if it did that law would never in a million years be constitutional if it were applied that way.  The constitution is not a document that deprives those who are not in power of the same things that those in power have access to.  Obama was surveiling every foreigner Trump was in contact with and you think a law would be constitutional that would so tip the balance of power so that it would make it illegal for the opposing party that is not in power to even investigate malfeasance?"
God damn. That Hilary photo is going to give me nightmares *Shudders
">Don JR investigates Hillary Clinton's criminal activity
>Media: COLLUSION COLLUSION!! SEE?"
Donald Trump Junior has Roadhog's belly button on his chin.
"sorry philip, but ur missing the main point, Donald Trump JR. wasnt part of the campaign and didnt have to disclose anything nor any other obligation... end of story"
"What makes the Trump Jr. story a non-story is the literally ten separate narratives proven false and manufactured by leftist media to claim Trump is somehow in it with the Russians.  Why should we take story #11 at face value?

Is Don Jr. a liar?  Dr. House would say so, and he's got the same credibility they have at this point--and he's fictional!  Otherwise, someone in and around politics LIED?  Ermagherd!  Say it ain't so!  I don't think in their right mind has accused Trump of being a good man, and I doubt the apple falls very far from the tree.  (Wait, no, Rudi accused him of being a good man during the RNC didn't he?  Well, the man's getting old I guess...)

Dems and their media lapdogs are still fishing for something, anything..."
"Choose the best definition for ""other thing of value"" (10:41)

A) a very memorable or passionate  object to which holds dear value.
B) Actual monetary Currency.
C) That little robot on the left side of Phil's head that sometimes moves.
D) explicit or deviant acts."
"I always feel terrible when I fall asleep to the show, but Phil, ya voice is just so damn smooth!"
The black block were ridiculous in Hamburg.
"I wouldn't be surprised if Lauren Southern is actually reveling in the fact she was targeted. She and her base thrive on painting any of their ideological opponents as crazy violent thugs. While these guys certainly were, she tends to go to protests in order to provoke and anger."
See you again psy  üòÇ
"Seeing you put the word ""Main"" instead of ""Maine"" as the word for the state just kills me."
"Leave it to liberals to be offended by the ""Identitarian"" movement.  Not going to lie, never heard of this yet another movement.  However this one seems to be sane, supporting preservation of ""national identity"" and western values.  Primarily though it is an anti-jihad movement.  Only the left would be offended by an anti-jihad movement.  I guess they would rather be stoned, raped, and beaten to death for not being a muslim.  Leftists. Fucking. Idiots. All of them.

This is just more blatant examples of the bigotry that is pretty much the left's entire agenda nowadays."
Lol the latest Planet of the Apes trilogy was complete trash anyway honestly
Antifa = Anti-First Amendment
"Trump Jr. certainly lied, but I don't think he broke the law. I imagine the intent of the law was to prevent actual financing. If you extend it so information falls under ""anything of value"" then what wouldn't? It's very likely a court would interpret that to be a tangible, measurable value and not something like dirt or other information."
kinda pisses me off when he talks about politics and trump bullshit for half the video..
"It's A ""Nothing Burger""."
"So he saw an ape with a blue vest, and thought it looked like a guy that wore a similar vest...wow, that's really telling of how they see themselves--who's the racist now?"
niggers looking for racism evrywhere
Spelled Maine wrong in the description
"So if I was 1/32 Russian and asked to have a meeting with Trump Jr., would that be a collusion? Because thats what I'm getting at with this story."
Trump jr is not the president so why do we care . People said the same thing about bill Clinton on trump about locker room talk so fuck off
"your opinion is the gospel, i wuv you"
I hate the antifa that act as fascists. You make the rest of us pushing for equal rights look insane. You want immigration to be allowed? Cool dude. I'm with you. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN BEATING UP AND SHUTTING DOWN THOSE THAT HATE IMMIGRANTS. BY SILENCING THEM YOU ARE BEING WHAT YOU HATE. It's garbage.
"DeRay appears to be kind of an idiot. ""Planet of the Apes"" has a guy in a blue vest. So what?! It is not targeting him. That is a big movie franchise who probably do not even know about this guy and how he wears blue vests and if they do know he does, I highly doubt they are basing this movie off of him. Very egocentric if you ask me!"
"Someones going to get shot at one of these riots and everyones going to lose their shit

ken u just stop now plz"
NO SECRET LINK?????
"to the guy who called the news guy a nazi. do you honestly know why he would be a nazi? because i'm pretty sure you just blindly followed the people who identified this news team and told you to go after them. well done, you're an idiot who can't think for himself. it's people like you who make it so other peaceful protesters don't get taken seriously."
"So no outrage over Hilary Clinton being directly funded by Saudi Arabia? I don't like either candidate, but it's a bit hypocritical to only have the media point out trumps story"
"Hey guys, great idea! Let's show these intolerant people how intolerant they are by being even more intolerant than they are and actually assault them! Also, join me as a stab myself in the foot as an act of tolerance... (the sarcasm is strong in this one)"
"""other thing of value"" is so vague I'm surprised it even got passed into law."
What has the world come to. People will attack others if they do or may not support their ideas. We as a species really need to think of how dumb this is.
"Is ""FREAKING OUT"" on every vid? I'm kinda new here."
We should be trying to find out what the new is about our past to help our future
Many of these social justice types are really professional victims and thrive off of victimhood status. Civil rights leaders from decades ago yearned for a day without racism and openly racist laws and traditions. Black Lives Matter would be jobless without racism
beating some one up because you thing there a fascist is in itself pretty freaking fascist.
"Loved the show. And the links. (Especially the Maine Lobster one-the John Cena one was funny :) Creature of habit, where's my ""secret link of the day""? Hmmmm? Amanda? @MandaOhDang"
I honestly never saw Planet of the apes as racist and not everything invoking primates is associated with black people. People are reaching to far.
"I'm actually really intrigued as to how the whole Russia-Trump situation plans out, being British I've never had a dog in this fight but it's intriguing non the less"
"I think for the Hillary/ Ukraine thing, that's completely different. The Ukraine providing info on Trump to his opponent isn't the same as Trump allegedly working with a foreign power to rig an election."
Okay Russia gave us something about bill Clinton.. so what's ur point
fuck BLM. fuck antifa
Everybody is exaggarating this story like trump is gonna get impeached but so far theres nothing out of this story besides people on the left screeching at people on the right saying this is the person they support... The people in the comments over at TYT were full retard mode and showed their intolerance and stupidity while calling the right stupid
"Obvoiously a attakk on him, as was da 60's movies he jus hurt cause he got no p-rivelidge."
Didn't anyone else notice that the author of the DJT story complained on Twitter that he's been working on this for a year? Which means he had access to DTJ's private email after just under a month. How did the media get access to this private citizen's personal email? Another example of illegal unmasking and leaking to the press from the previous administration for political reasons?
It's pronounced D-ray DeRay

I know riots are bad but you have to admit that it does look fun to burn cars rob buildings and punch random people.
more fake news
"I just think it's pathetic and dismaying that there are people who exist who think a fictional ape in a fictional movie who is wearing a vest for the purpose of showing off that this ape is a new, mysterious, and special character in the franchise with a particular role in the movie is somehow racist. Phil is correct in saying that ""Bad Ape"" (his identity in the teasers) is wearing the coat because apes are progessivley becoming more like humans as the plot indicates. People need to stop looking for issues in places where there it doesn't make sense for there to be any present."
"Why is Germany allowed to even have an opinion? Seriously, as an American citizen of Germany decent, I'm more inclined to tell people I'm of Irish decent, which I am on my mother's side, than German. Germany, just because two of the most egregious, vile inhuman crimes against humanity came from your loins, doesn't mean you can try to blow up the earth, ""for justice"". 
Germany is like Superman from the Injustice Timeline. ""Bad things happened. Let's ruin the earth itself."" You're not helping Germany, so I'm going to give you some the same advice your last two prime minister's have tried to give the U.S.. ""Stay the hell out of other people's business."""
"Most talented nicest person you have ever met probably equates to human waste. I mean your buds with that casey you tuber douche bag. Stay off my girl Lizza both of you!

That's a no no. Stop trying to be cool, these subjects aren't cool and stop pointing out others faults to make yourself look better because it only makes me trash talk you!"
"BLM and ANTIFA are terrorists! Using violence to push their agenda, the more we ignore it the more it will spread, the more it spreads the more it validates actual racists/fascists of their opinions, and the more it validates their opinions the more likely that other people will be convinced."

"If you walk into the ghetto butt ass naked and after drinking 12 beers and get raped suggesting you could have done something different to prevent that is called blaming the victim by leftists.

6:14
"Important thing to remember is that yeah, overreaching will make a movement look stupid, so people should try and learn to not judge an entire movement by one person overreaching.
Like, someone once suggested Chris Pratt's character being tan in Jurrasic world was brownface. Obviously that was a silly overreach, but it doesn't completely dismiss the complaints of actual whitewashing or brown/blackfacing in media and real life (I feel like every other month people have to remind the cosplay community to stop blackfacing).
Yeah, overreaching needs to stop, but every group will have people who try to or accidentally make drama."
DeRay Mckesson claiming Planet of the Apes were inspired by him is like the retail version of Lindsay Lohan suing Rockstar for the GTA V bikini girl.
How is making light of Hillary's horrendous email conduct somehow make President Trump an evil demon?? FUCK you guys. People running for president are trying to win at any possible corner. How about CNN giving Hillary debate questions before hand? There have NEVER been ethics in politics or any government for that matter. Its a very Machiavellian landscape but it is the country we AMERICANS live in and we as Americans chose Trump. So deal with him and try again in four years you pathetic cunts.
yo idk how you do it but you always put out the best stories lol
Duuude. Hilary is not the president. Why the fuck Trumpters still about trying to dig up dirt on her? Obama is not the president anymore either. Why ignore all the shit Trump does to focus on ancient history? Is this some ineffectual and pathetic attempt to make Drump look better or what? It will never work.
This is not protesting it's terrorism. I hope to God that Antifa gets on the terrorists watch list
I know this is off topic and I doubt anyone from the PDS will read this but it would be nice if you guys brought back the giveaways. Maybe you could give away gift cards/t-shirts etc. to the comments you use for the Friday show. I know you guys are trying to start the news network and all but it was nice when Phil gave back in that way to his audience....just an idea
"To the people saying ""Hillary isn't relevant anymore"": This is a story about the campaign, with evidence from during the campaign, with legal questions raised by behavior during the campaign, in the midst of a months-long media assault about interference or impropriety in the campaign. Who else was campaigning and their conduct during said campaign is absolutely relevant here. And it's absolutely fucking rich to me people are trying to stretch the definition of ""contribution"" to ""even meeting someone from a foreign country"" to nail someone when I shouldn't even have to write out what I'm implying at this point from the other side.  The scale of that issue, and the scale of that delusion is immense. Punish both sides of there's legal reason, absolutely, but come on."
"How...how did he possibly think Matt Reeves was like ""ya put a blue puffy jacket on bad ape, that'll show those black lives matters activists,"" bad ape is a good guy in the movie too and the whole planet of the apes franchise started as an allegory for race relations."
Eh just another blm supporter.  A group of terroirsts ruining the world.
"Antifa are terrorists, call it out"
"Philando Castille is pretty much the only true instance in the last few years when BLM's sorry asses have existed, when a truly innocent black man was shot.  All the other ""innocent"" black people who have been shot by police and it being over exposed by the media all wound up in one form or another, breaking the law, resisting arrest, fleeing, just leaving a crime they committed, or attacking the cops.  I seriously can't think of another black dude since Mike Brown happened (and it's funny because Mike Brown is quite possibly the most guilty fucker of them all....  robbed a store, ignored cop to get off street, attacked cop through window of vehicle, ran away, turned around and charged said cop...... but he was a ""poor, innocent victim"" yeah... ok) other than Castille who was truly doing nothing wrong whatsoever.  The fact that there is only like 3.... MAYBE 4 of these ""blacks killing black people 'in cold blood'"" cases per year tells you how RARE it is.  I mean think about it.  Black people make up 13% of the population.  It's pretty much just black males who commit the most crime out of the black population, so about 6-6.5% of the total population.  Of that, let's say, 6.5% the number of males over the age of, say, 13 has to be like 5%... TOPS.  What am I getting at?  5% of the population is pretty much responsible for 37% of all violent crime in the US (Rape, murder, robbery, assault, etc.).  5% of the population commit over 50% of the murders in this country.  And black people seriously wonder why they are being ""profiled.""  When does ""profiling"" stop being profiling and the cops just doing their job.  Castille, while innocent, was pulled over - not because of a broken tail light - but because he fit the description of a suspect they were looking for.  That's not Castille's fault, but my guess it wouldn't have happened if black America wasn't responsible for a majority of the crime in this country.  Just saying.  Willing to bet if black people just stopped breaking the law at the insane rate they currently do the ""profiling"" would cease to happen.  I mean if America is SOOOOO racist why don't hispanics bitch about it as much as black people do?  If America is SOOOOO racist why are Asian-America and Indian-American people wealthier on average than white people?  Are black people so self absorbed they think they are the only ones that are ""being held back"" by racism?  Fuck off."
"Politics are corrupt, why are people surprised? It's like all this stuff is new to people. Obama did illegal things, Bush did illegal things, Trump has most likely done illegal things. If someone is running for presidential office they've made illegal deals somewhere down the road. That's just how politics are these days."
All live matter. Not just black live. I understand that other live have it easy but there are others that have it harder. All live matter
Philip DeFranco I may not always agree with you but at the end of the day your just a reporter doing your job thank you. Your always funny and bring light to things.
"Ok, this might be getting a little out of hand. I¬¥m all for ending racism, but are we really gonna bitch at clothes? It¬¥s not even cultural misappropriation he¬¥s just wearing a blue vest. It¬¥s about as silly as thinking that wearing a sombrero and drinking tequila is appropriating mexican culture. I¬¥m from Mexico and let me tell you something: no one cares."
"Okies - so it is not a new concept that the apes movies represent a racial message.   It has been around ever since the remake and I am sure before.   From a white and hopefully minimally racist perspective I would say this - the original movie and the second one did not leave me feeling happy about the human side of things.   It was horrific disgusting dissapointing and sad.  Irrespective of whether apes represent a minority in our own society or are in this movie a minority society of any kind being suppressed I invariably always side with the apes.  That said the crazy characters of each side ape or human are always scary.  That is the design of the movie - hero's victims and bad guys.   

I understand that the suggestion that black people are animals can be seen as an ugly one... Some of us prefer animals.  I never have to wonder if animal is dishonest with me and I know that all of them are less parasitic than humans.  And as I curl up with my furry fluff ball every night and he lovingly rests a paw and head on my lap I quietly wish the world was less populated by people and more populated by these genuine beings.

Hucksters and Black Bloc trash. And glad to see he posted the emails.
"That's how People want to hand anything anymore Phil. Some say they here to protest to bring about peace but really they're usually the ones who ruin it by going in a making something that didn't start off violent and make it in to that, and it hurts the cause of anything. Some people do use violence to get their point across, others don't use facts but their own opinions to get the point across, and some just jump the gun on anything and start say and doing things to get their point across before analyzing and things it out first."
half the people in BLK are ignorant and fucking stupid. specifically those who think terms like apes is racist
You are right
"If you're running for office and someone offers you information about your enemy, who in the world wouldn't want to obtain that information?"
"Are you really saying that this is the reason why you are happy that Charlie Puth video has more views than Psy's video? because just for your knowledge Psy has been in the music business for over 10 years. He suffered harsh comments throughout his career about his looks in Korea, and this is all you have to say? I don't really care who has the largest amount of viewers in YouTube. It just bothered me that this is the reason you gave."
"love this way of getting news.
there's no hidden agenda with this guy get days what he believes and still gives equal and fair news."
"There are many cases in the G20 story where cops where counted as wounded at the slightest thing, I know one in particular was a cop who 'hurt his hand' punching a protester, the number is super inflated"
"Right now it seems like the ""smoking gun"" is that the son of a political candidate met with a lawyer who says that she has official information from an obviously fictitious Russian official--there's no crown in Russia--because she was friends with a guy who's father was awarded a medal by Putin, and maybe that works if you think that the information being given to him freely has value. Seems thin, but who knows, it could all change by the Friday show."

"The thing is, Trump Jr was not part of the campaign nor was he running for election. There is no breach of the law here and if anyone accepted foreign bribes, Clinton campaign and the Clinton foundation has some explaining to do. Personally I think this is more nothing burger being pedaled so the NewYork Times and other MSM can continue to get Washington backing for this expensive waste of taxpayers time and money. I think about every day this waste of resources goes on because no one wants to just deal with the reality that Hilary lost the election on her own."

"So emails to peoples from countries with horrible human rights offences is perfectly fine, but russia is a huge deal?"
"More black people are talking about the ""comparison to apes"" than white people
Black people are more racist than whites, racism is constantly on their mind.
If they just stop thinking about it all the time and start treating people as people rather than black people and white people, racism would slow down/or end itself"
"Hillary blamed Russia for her loss.. (Obama's) intelligence wanted to check DNC servers but Hillary n Dems say nope, ""no votes were compromised"". Yet we get nearly a yr of ""Trump..

How much crime is out there because people are suffering and have nothing? how many 1%'s, ¬†the people that you are serving right now, are planning mass murder, divisions, war, and genocide? Fuck you man! Your a little cunt! Your way of thinking is why the world is bas bad as it is. Your just going along with it! Your morality is social relativism not absolute moral authority based so everything you think and say is wrong Though it makes sense lol. That's how pseudo intellectuals operate. Violence in this world, destruction of this world is something that is good and that's scary when its good to destroy, its indicative of a society unfit to live!"

"The very reason lawyers exist is to ""twist the law"" to their benefit. I believe this is a clear example of collusion. The major problem with our current society is that we have gotten so good at talking we can now convince you that nothing is everything. Real news, fake news...One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, etc. Once again people will simply twist the interpretation of this particular narrative to agree with their politics. But it does not change the fact that the Trumps attempted to work with a foreign government to affect the election, knowingly I might add‚Ä¶ Let's see where the three ring circus takes us now. Sadly I don't imagine it's going to be toward the betterment of this nation or the world in general. We are getting very close to the tipping point. If all this bullshit doesn't help to convince us that fundamental reform of many of our institutions is sorely needed, I don't know what will convince us as a country. I fear we are not far from the whole ball of wax bursting into flames, if we don't make some major changes to instill confidence in our country. Maybe we could start with making America decent again and then perhaps we may find the road that leads to greatness‚Ä¶"

"Something i dont seem to understand is that Trump jr is not a polititan, he doesnt have a position in the white house, his only connection to the white house is that he is related to the president. So why is he being treated like the vice president?"
it's sad when you want to protect a country and the people who live there fight back. why?
"The Russians have dirt on the Democrats. The Russians have dirt on the Republicans. It's almost like they want the American people at odds with one another to further their own political position.

"I'm no lawyer but I can't really find the whole thing trump jr did as illegal if only for one reason, that the information in question would be knowledge of a crime. Because, if I'm getting this right the Russian lawyer was supposed to have incriminating evidence right? There is no way the law can be interpreted to where it prevents foreigners from telling u.s officials/campaign people about crimes. I'm not sure how I feel about the morality of the whole thing, but I really don't think it is illegal."
"People keep saying ''f nazis, eff nazis F nazis'' But they're all forgetting about communists and left wing extremists. And they do exist, it's just extremism on the other side.  And that's mostly because the west had no problems with communism. I don't know how this thing would play out in eastern Europe but I stand by my word as a left winger myself that the west is trying communism as an experiment."

"Hey guys, we're about to get into world war 3 with our direct opponent being, with trump being president, BUT YOU KNOW THAT TRUMP IS TOTALLY WITH RUSSIA AND THIS STORY IS CLEARLY BASED IN REALITY AND FACT. I don't know if people are retarded or what, but this whole mess is actually retarded."
"Honestly, I think it's way off base to even wonder if it's illegal, at this point. I think there's two things there; one, they're clearly twisting the meaning of ""Other Contributions"" in a way that is disingenuous and would set a really hard, broad precedent, legally. I also think there's too much focus on trying to shove a square peg in a round spot to try and screw someone the left doesn't like with the law. Think of the situation in a personal, ""tactical"" sense; a close contact said ""Hey, I might have something that could help."" That went from ""Russian attorney"" to ""Russian Government support"" real quick. Maybe he didn't want to drop it in case, take the meeting as a formality and not piss off his friend? However, if this is the full chain and full conversation, he does still want to hear it after that, which is spotty. But on the chain we have, nothing much happened after that point. 

I also feel there might be some distraction element to this. Despite what many seem to think, I don't think Trump and his whole family are monstrous Machiavellian schemers while at the same time being entirely incompetent, stupid people, so I doubt he would just drop all of this without consulting his lawyers first and thinking about this. Any way it goes, even if it was partially to counter a ravenous news media, I think it reflects very well on him that he went for full transparency on this, no editing, even if it had an inkling of impropriety."

"I don't have an opinion on the whole planet of the apes thing.. Phil is probably correct that Deray read into the blue vest thing too much. However, I think it is important to note that Deray is an extremely qualified individual. He used to be a math teacher and now has a podcast (with Obama's former speechwriter) where he discusses social issues. I'm still a fan of Pod Save America, even though I don't always agree with everything they say. Glad that Phil is holding them accountable bc they have a large audience."

Even if you agree with the views of these groups, you feel a sense of unease because you don't agree 100% or don't agree with their methods."
"Reality is that no matter how hard we try to differentiate between ideologies (or philosophies, religions, doctrines, or whatever that conforms a belief system), in the end and in practice you have people who is WILLING to commit physical violence and those who don‚Äôt (of course that you have cues on what they claim to think, but facts speak louder than words). And that is what affects societies the most. Thus that reality should keep being the final legal cut between people (those who act violently or promote violence and those who will not) as it is in many places of the West (thinking and expressing your thought is not a crime but clearly hurting others or promoting others to be hurt is). Of course certain systems of beliefs promote violence over empathy but that doesn‚Äôt exclude the extremism even on those system of belief that claim to be absolutely peaceful or empathic. Words goes with the win, actions will always speak louder."

"I think you hit it in the nail Phil, Don Jr.'s defense is ""we tried but we didn't pull it off"". There's a reason why Attempted Murder is still a crime. Yeah, it's a bit of a stretch, but 'attempted to collude with a foreign enemy government' should also be a crime."
"I think the two wrongs don't make a right is lost but so is perspective.¬† Can we really lose our minds over this meeting due to its potential 'value of a thing' and calmly accept straight up cash donations for other campaigns.¬† Legal or not currently, I think both things are terrible and if we are going to go apeshit over this lawyer meeting we should be ALSO pressing lawmakers to ban this foreign aid into campaigns completely so it isn't even a question anymore."

Yet they also do it in clothes, phones, and I'm sure cars to get to the event which they got through oooh yeah capitalism. They are so against capitalism because they want everything handed to them yet don't understand communism has never worked and always ends up with a stronger government controlling everything. Same back in the states as a student on a college campus it's sickening how many dumb people believe communism and killing people to get there is right. All because?? You have to work, every single of those people think they are smart because they are in college yet do theater or liberal ""arts"", so obviously not learning anything worth wild to the world like engineering that you can actually make money with. It's just sickening. Hopefully they all grow up one day and open a history book."

Both parties have issues, but getting into a pissing match of a blame game isn't the way to go. We're Americans; let's not let one president ruin our faith and sense of tolerance.

The Left is so sure that Russia hacked our election but no one questions why they are so sure with no proof. Hillary was supposed to win because the game is fixed and when Trump won they didnt know how to handle it. They cant admit the election is fixed so what do they do? That is just my opinion. The Government is just too corrupt. We need to find a way to unite instead of following their divide and conquer agenda. Everywhere you look Republican vs Democrat, White vs Black, LGBTQ+ vs CIS, Christian vs Muslim, Citizen vs Immigrant, America vs Russia,Theist vs Atheist.,etc. Where does it end? 2nd Civil War?

Please someone find this man a hobby until he finds an argument to validate his idiocity...if there ever is a planet of the apes it won't be because apes triumf over  humans, it'll be because us humans are  involving and losing the sense of what ""society"" is, stands for and is useful for"
No secret link you cunt
We dont want the new normal in american politics to be campaigns looking for propaganda from foreign countries intelligence services.  we should censure (or worse) the trump team for what they did there.
I'm offensive and I find that black.
I'm guessing not too many people cared about the second story the first and third were way more political
You just gotta love Antifa...stopping Fascism by using Fascist Tactics.....
everything is racist nowüòÇ
But your a Nazi! You are! You go along with this shit! You own how many cell phones? You know microwaves are harmful to people right? not to mention that its surveillance how do you think your not a Nazi? because you say so? Everything goes to motive certainly but those motives must line up with your actions to be effective otherwise your a fucking Nazi just like thw Germans that did nothing were!
If I was in charge of investigating Trump campaign connections with Russia and I heard that one of the people I'm investigating might not have colluded (The writing of the law is ambiguous) but they sure as hell tried to I'd probably be assigning more investigators. After all if they tried once and failed it's highly likely they tried again.

"Lauren wasn't attacked? So disappointed.

You're very mistaken if you think Antifa is preaching tolerance to nazis. This is entirely consistent with any discussion about them.

I support Antifa in this."

"Fuck Black Lives Matters, bunch of racist in a hate group."
If Russia helped republicans with opposition research and Ukraine helped the democrats with opposition research how long have things like this been going on? For all we know the Obama administration could have been helped by foreign governments. Judging from the fact that Clinton didn't get in trouble there must be some understanding in Washington that acquiring information about an opponent from a foreign government is not considered collusion.
"The big problem with the Red-baiting is that it divert the attention to the elephant in the room. As the content of the Podesta E-mails was stating, the DNC is completely sold out to corporate interests. So tor the working class voter, there is no way not to vote against their own interest."
"Another nothingburger, I thought they were saying he did something illegal, but he hasn't.  Hillary did the same thing during the 2016 campaign, and the news openly reported it.

Before people scream fire, CITE THE ACTUAL LAW THESE PEOPLE BROKE."
"What is the crime with the media is claiming the Trump committed?  The insinuation is that somehow they conspired to get the Russian government to hack the DNC and Podesta to get dirt on the Clintons so that it could be released during the election.  The hacking took place a year before this meeting occurred and it wasn't even publicly known the DNC was hacked when this meeting took place.  Even if the campaign got compromising info from a foreign national, that is not a crime unless the campaign was involved in breaking the law to get that information.  The DNC were caught literally rigging the election in favor of Hillary over Sanders and major news organizations were caught giving debate questions to Clinton and allowing her campaign to proof read articles before they were printed.  Meeting with foreign officials and nationals is a normal activity during and after a campaign.  The only reason they say this is different is because Russia hacked the DNC but have provided little evidence and what has been presented seems to suggest that it was someone inside the DNC was responsible for getting the emails.   You don't have to like Trump but it should be plain to see for all that the establishment is trying to do everything they can to destroy him.  MSM 94% negative, Republicans in Congress keeping him from acting. bureaucrats leaking every piece of intel that might hurt him and withholding context, they even had the pope come out and attack him."
"""We couldn't figure it out!"""
The american political system must be the worst in the world...
trump jr. still broke the law
"Trump Jr is a non-story, because nothing illegal happened. Nothing illegal could have happened for that matter. Also, if those 'legal experts' are correct, then what about the freaking money Saudis poured into the Clinton campaign? That stuff is hardly a secret. She got pay-for-play money from quite a few foreign nations. And lets be truthful her, Trump Jr. is not a government official. He's not part of the Trump administration."
Is it just me or is this episode quite? Is there less sound effects or something?
Why people are FREAKING OUT blah blah blah again Phil?
"Since the only ape in clothes had the vest, i honetly thought about Deray fore even hearing bout the story. Granted now hearing the history I wonder if this ape is significant to the plot, idk, but i can definitely see how he'd initially feel targeted as well as i can see that it was probably not intentional. Think it was just a instance of jumping to conclusions (that i also kinda jumped to)."
"""It seems like more and more these days, people are trying to preach tolerance with their fists."" One more point in the Phil for President,Pros Column."
I'm so conflicted on the black lives matter movement. I'm completely for the essence of the movement but not for the activists who control it...
"I kind of feel like none of this even matters. First Hillary Clinton with the emails, now Donald Trump Junior with his emails, it just seems like it's all going to get swept under the rug like it always does. people are going to stop at half and throw tantrums, but at the end of the day these people are big political figures with money and that's all that really matters. nothing will happen to either of them."
its crazy that tyt defended the riot and said it was violent and non violent and when they were lighter shit on fire they said they were making bonfires tyt are just stupid
This white house is such a fuckfest.

Oh and also the wiz music video only blew up because of Paul walkers death and Paul (his social media) and his daughter I have noticed in the past couple weeks has increased social media activities not dissing the artist because I'm a fan and cried like a bitch at the end of that movie and still gets chocked up sometimes when I watch that music video all I'm saying it has more to do with piggy backing off the loss of a cool dude

"No matter what u think Phil, your opinion is Gospel to me"
where is the secret link?
the trump jr stuff is just a bunch of bs of it was turned out to be about Russian adoptions then whoopie de doo
"Deray, Tariq, get your heads checked. I come from a black family and for fucks sake, you idiots are trying too hard. It's a theme from a classic movie. If you want your  panties so twisted over something CLEARLY not THAT important, then at least try not looking like a pair of idiots doing so"
The New York Times is cancer.
"1) BLM making a fool of themselves, no surprise.
2) Antifa is anti-western terrorism 
3) The Don Jr email scandal looks bad but is another cry of outrage over something that will have no ramifications to President Trump. The meeting didn't even contain any Russian gov intel like suggested."
Um. So where is the Secret link?  Its not in the description like normal.
"Black lives matter is a racist hate group.  I have no desire to waste my time listing my criticisms of the BLM ""movement"" as having any critical thought or argument about them makes me a red neck Clan member."
What this tells me is that they didn't necessarily tried to collude.....but tried to get dirt on Hillary but failed.
"Honestly, I don't understand all of the Trump Jr thing, but my main thing with it in why I'm a bit more passive on it is because he publicized his email chain himself, or at least without having a court say he has to release it. Although it can be seen as a move to do some damage control, I'm not 100% sure of it, meaning I think he did want to release it himself to aid in transparency, or at the very least he could say that, ""Hey, don't start getting uppity with me, at least i did publish all of my email chains without having to be told by either the populace or by a court"" (Donald Trump Jr. looks at a camera like in ""The Office"" ) ""Mrs. Clinton..."" It may come back to bite him in the ass now but for the moment people, like myself are going to continue to say what I have in this comment, both now, and later on down the line, most likely, especially if this ends up being more or less nothing."
"Just picking up on something in the emails, I don‚Äôt believe there is a crown prosecutor of Russia, after all they got rid of the Tsar (royal family and crown) in 1917, as such with the inaccuracies, I am led to believe this is a bit of, ‚Äúlook I got a Russian official‚Äù only for it not to be, Trump Jr had to have known who the lawyer, was supposed to be, he knew which is why the, meeting was arranged."
I do however enjoy listening to you make sense.
"""We tried to colude, we couldn't figure it out"" That made me burst out laughing."

Fucking BLM making matter over nothing. When I saw the poster I just saw a bunch of fucking Chimpanzees with one with a vest on like a human. The only reason why that would be racist is because only racist people need it to be racist to have an argument.

"I agree with Phil in that violence is never an answer to anything, but wearing something that has far-right symbols on it within a protest like this is provocative. She wanted something to happen. May be nothing physical but she wanted a reaction to it. It's like wearing a ""Female Body Inspector""-shirt to a women's rights march. You know full well which kind of reaction you're gonna get wearing something like this to a protest that is comprised of largely left or even extreme left-wing people. Hamburg is famous/notorious (depends on your own perspective) for it's alternative/left scene. Should she or whoever was or wasn't associated with her have been made the target of a manhunt? Fuck no! Was she fully aware that her shirt was going to provoke a reaction and may be violence? Absolutely."

"Hey Phil, I agree that it was sleazy for Trump Jr. to talk to someone he thought had ""Dirt"" on Hillary... But that's par for the course my friend.  EVERY political race is built on not only showcasing your candidates good side but also the competitions bad side.  Also... Trump Jr. isn't technically a part of the campaign, so even by the interpretation you go over at about 10:25 he's still in the clear.  

On top of that I don't see that Trump Jr. was soliciting this Hillary information from the Russians.  Someone contacted him and offered it to him.  So he scheduled a time to talk to them.  That's what comes across in the emails anyway."
And unsubscribed.  What a joke.  looking for more money since more viewers are going for you over this bullshit after listening to Trump.

"The original Planet of the Apes was a civil rights era film based on (or rooted in) the ideas of the book ""Black like Me"" (where a white man put on blackface to experience what it was like to be black (including all of the discrimination and such). It's supposed to be an anti-racist film. The thing is, it is an inherently weird movie because it uses apes in place of black people in it's metaphor (which isn't great). Anyway, my reaction to you covering this is--WHY ARE YOU COVERING A STUPID MINOR MISTAKE BY SOMEONE (which isn't that strange of a mistake to make given the film's history) AND THING BEING LIKE ""well, maybe it invalidates his whole argument."" Shrug. I don't actually care about black lives. Let me whimsically suggest this maybe invalidates their whole argument. What a vomitous thing to do."

"By the way, WTF do you mean with 'an actual Youtuber' now has the crown? Psy was a Youtuber. He's been on Youtube as an artist since 2010. His Gangnam Style super hit is from 2012.

Heck, Bieber's ""Sorry"" is pretty much way up there with 2.6 billion views. Added to that there's a serious race amongst Youtubers trying to keep Gangnam Style the most viewed on Youtube. It's not really about the song anymore. That hype died years ago."

If she had done something criminal with Russia and they were going to tell him does he not have a duty to find out what that is!? Surely he can't be expected to say no this would help us I don't want to know about this criminal activity. As if. All this does is prove there was no Russian collusion and the entire narrative is horse crap. All the media that peddled it trying to bait two counties into ever worsening relations should apologise. The American people and Russian people have nothing to fall out about it's time to get a damn grip"
This information was disclosed to Congress in Paul Manaforts testimony months ago.

"Frankly I don't see the whole hubbub over the meeting between Jr. and the lawyer, since all it proves is that:

1) Jr. did not accept the info offered and was forth coming of the transcipts between him and the lawyer.

2) The lawyer apparently had no connection to the Russian government 

3) Gives the only connection that Russia wanted Trump to win which is not out of the ordinary in most past elections and the 2016 election since multiple foreign organizations and national governments have put their support and desire toward a candidate winning the election to the point of huge donations.

Nazism is an extinct political party from 1930's Germany. 

Even if someone wanted to be - they could not possibly be a Nazi. A fascist, sure, they could even hold all the same beliefs and approve of National Socialism but even that may not be enough.

Nazi is a specific political party that isn't on any ballot anywhere anymore. You can't be a Nazi. 

Also, it's laughable, this idea that you could ""spit on Nazis with words all day""; I've seen you recoil when asked simple questions about wealth redistribution, claiming you felt attacked, and other nonsense.

"While I Seriously doubt that Planet of the Apes was making a Deray reference in any way (I doubt they even knew about him until he tweeted and it got big), we need to understand the full context. It's a trailer. It's a small peek of the movie and a pop vinyl. There is literally NOTHING that suggests that the movie is racially biased in any sense, or attacking anyone of colour until the full movie is released. If that character in the vest is played to behave like a stereotypical black man, or makes any reference to Deray (And I again, SERIOUSLY doubt it) then by all means, call it the fuck out. But you can't claim shit on a 5 second preview of a specific scene."
i dont get it. Donald trump jr. doesnt need to gain any money or good to make it illegal. you know what they got? trump in the white house. thats the only reason they were there and that is what they gained. THAT is valuable. being president is valuable. it's illegal.
"Will black people EVER stop playing victim?  Just wondering.  I mean I've already tuned their bitching and whining out already I just wanted to know if I would have to do that for the rest of my life.  I'll take Black Lives Matter seriously once they get their sorry asses to Chicago and protest the daily black on black killing that goes on around here.  Until then they are no better than a racist mob the likes of the KKK IMO.  I mean when BLM supporters leave rallies for a fe minutes to email racist threats themselves and then return to said rally and talk about how they're receiving racist threats (that they just sent themselves from a dummy account) to prove how racist America is tells you how lame their agenda is and how little actual racism there is in this country.  Seriously, dealing with the left is like dealing with perpetual toddlers.  Pretty much every liberal ""issue"" is a fucking joke nowadays with mountains of data, facts, statistics, research, etc. that supports the sane, conservative stance on just about everything.  The only issue I think I can agree with liberals on is legalization of weed.  And that's just for tax revenue purposes mainly."
I don't like the government having law limiting protest but he need to do something before are right to protest are taken away by dumbass like Antifa and people who support them. We should make the black block illegal so we Can just arrest everyone involved.

"Looking at Tolerance I can't help but see the hypocrisy in it. Tin foil hat or not,  If there's a terrorist bombing in England they demand tolerance and acceptance, or supporting Muslims / integration etc. Yet if one crazy ""white supremacist"" (as they all are I guess but that would be calling the Kettle black as the saying goes imho) and saying there should be hate towards white people is the same tolerance? That's also to mention the tolerance for Pedophiles (according to Paul Joseph Watson (who is part of info wars but doesn't make his points invalid)) and other atrocities which make tolerance an even dirtier word. I also wonder why Lauren is looked down upon, yet buzzfeeds intolerance for logic / reason or all around vile disgusting content (little girls who seem to be what 8 or 9 using foul language and talking about rape (aka brainwashing)) is welcome or their period blood (which I understand many of you haven't worked in many of the large corporate / federal establishments in which all blood is considered contaminated which also can contain many diseases which is why blood in general is disgusting) is accepted to the point it's been on the trending list. 

¬†Of course I'm glad Colombia isn't in the headlines otherwise I'd have to practice either being a professional victim or defensive of myself for what I had been born into (even though my mother is white I am Hispanic according to all job applications disregarding my Native American / Irish Great Grand parents). Since having a Diverse background gives me free reign apparently to say what I like on race issues without actually being involved, thanks BLM / SJW's. 

Point being, being pigeonholed into areas simply for questioning is really sad (since Lauren, Paul, and many of the other people speaking out are in the actual areas viewing the atrocities occurring yet are labeled in tolerant, yet when in their main countries they murder homosexuals / refuse to condemn Hamas and actually support the murdering of Jewish people it's not?)"

We are Antifa!  Hey, you look like a jerk, that makes you a....FASCIST!  We shall punch you.  Hey, that car just muttered something racist, let's burn it!  Hey look, this street has cars, let's burn those down.  Is that a plate glass window?  I see a fascist reflected in it, we must stop it by smashing the glass ceiling that is on it's side!"
As a black person who supports BLM and police accountability but those two guys are triggered assholes. This makes the rest of all BLM look as if they cry wolf.
"People need to be stupid to engage in violence just because someone else shares a different opinion than you. I think people should only get physical when physically threatened, not because of hate speech (I do not believe in hate speech) or because of different viewpoints."
"""hurting their own cause"" what? phil, nobody cares, if you are a leftist, the media will defend you. i doubt antifa and these groups will ever get any serious condemnation and  this will continue until they start killing people."
I've definitely never seen this title before
I was a bit startled when I clicked on this video and got an ad.  I thought I had somehow gotten the wrong channel.  LOL
fuck u philip defuck!ss
"Nothing says being against fascism like dressing in all black, covering your faces, looting, arson, and targeting people who have different political views than you and attacking them. Never change Antifa, you're one of my favorite memes."
"I heard from a very reliable source that pres trump, likes to use russian dressing on his salad."
I hate your face
WHO FUCKING CARES... If i was trump i would open up hillary investigation and all her dealings >> fucking dumb whore did 10x more then trump ever thought of but nobody talks about it
Donald Jr. technically violated the Logan Act.
"Telling the truth about Hillary isn't a crime now, is it ? Hope not."
Nice that you cover Lauren and Luke's story
Do a face reveal.
Gotta love the professionally offended. The loudest and the most vocal on either side further divide and don't help a damn thing.
Identarian?  What the serious fuck?  Did I hear that right?
where da secret link?
"kill the protesters, they are communists and last time I checked, communists aren't humans, they're animals"
so he thought the guy in the blue was him.....idiot
"Love to say something here, but once it becomes the top comment DeFranco will delete the comment."
"Donald Trump Jr disclosed the meeting last year to the Federal Government and the FBI, nothing of value was even passed during the meeting, and now we discover that he was unmasked in the Susan Rice scandal, and the information was leaked via James Comey to a reporter who is now losing his absolute SHIT on twitter because DTJ released his e-mails one hour before this guys story was set to drop. https://i.redd.it/1xapvw7tiz8z.jpg. We now also learned that the lawyer everyone is claiming is like to the RU Gov, is NOT. 

It's literally nothing. Please Philip, do actual research into this outside of twitter. You're normally a lot better then this, but this one is just horse shit of speculations. CNN is trying to spin a narrative right now, saying DTJ received the DNC hacks in this meeting, and published them to tarnish the Dems. The first outlet to let this ""breaking development"" out? Washington Post. Who works for WaPo? John ""Drop The Blocks and Suck The Cock, Kid"" Podesta. The very same person President Trump was tweeting about on Friday at G20, while discussing WHY the DNC would not allow the FBI to overview their server hack.

So lets see. We have a lose fitted tie to ""muh Russia"", blame for the DNC leaks, horrible reporting, James Comey leaking the info to Jared Yates, Susan Rice unmasking the meeting that took place TO James Comey, and in a single tweet, Donald Trump Jr completely nukes the narrative of the MSM. Like father like son. Taking the fake news out right at the kneecaps.

Also, no laws were violated because no information was gathered at this meeting. It was entirely disclosed. DO YOUR RESEARCH PLEASE."
I think he should also scream at the zoo. The other day the big ape at the zoo scratched his ass just like he did.
"S√∂hren Kohlhuber wasnt just a ANTIFA Photographer, he was actually employed by ""Die Zeit"" a big german Newspaper which makes his actions even worse."
Marvel had a few Muslim messages....So.........They eventually get canned.
"on the black lives matter story, they are all idiots doing idiot things because they're idiots. I drive a black Hyundai and they would probably equate that with me picking black because I associate that with slavery. we know we have a problem with race in America, those individuals are not helping their cause by crying wolf over nonsensical things"
I only recently found out Charlie Puth was the one that did the CTFxC and a bunch of other youtubers intros years ago.
Black lives matter has already been ruined by the likes of Tana mojo and others like her. Tariq and blue vest guy (he has a very forgettable name) are just adding insult to injury
"Antifa are simply fascists in all but name, they are no different than nazis themselves"
lol people are so crazy... like the black lives matter movement is so flawed and dangerous. sooo almost all white people are racist huh? well how did we get an black president??? look there is still racism in America but its both ways and movements like that only further divide us
"Two wrongs don't make a right but one wrong is clearly worse, the one involving Hillary"
"One nation under g.o.d (Gold, oil, drugs)"

where's my goddamn secret link ?
"Haven't watched this yet, saving for tomorrow but Lauren Southern is based so Phil better be nice."
NOT EVERYTHING IS RACIST üò≠
"Can we get back to health care Trump is president Clinton lost. now how are we going to make ""America great again"""
"i completely agree with you Phil, i'm surprised we call these violent events ""protests"". A protest should be a peaceful peach/chant debating your opinion. Rioting should be a term used to describe these events.  once you turn to violence your side and debate is irrelevant to me. i hope  this shit changes, and changes real quick."
When I saw deray my eyes rolled so far in the back of my head I could see the brain cells dying right before my eyes
"Did I vote for Trump? No. But Hillary lost, why does it still seem like such a priority for Donald Trump/Donald Trump Jr. to try and take her down? Seems like they should be focusing more on ""making America great again"""
Antifa=scum of the earth
Lauren Southern is a racist white nationalist pig. Don't really care much if Antifa bashes that fash.
Gotta be honest I immediately went to gangnam style after this....sorry phil
"Dude DeFranco, who are you? What are your credentials? Do you even have a journalism degree. Who are you other than a self righteous mook with a camera? I really would love to know your qualifications for acting like this moral authority"
"I swear to god If I hear another person call the g20 summit shit ""protests"" I'm gonna flip out. those aren't protests THEY'RE RIOTS. there is no fire in a protest. there is no death, injury or destruction."
"Tim pool hangs out with identitarians
Tries to stay unbiased"
"what about pedophilia on top 6,7 youtube trend video parents teach kids masturbation"
Europeans protest much harder than we do here in the states. I do not agree with what happened to the Identitarians that came to cover the summit but they should have done a little research before showing up. I think any kind of violence voids the legitimacy of your stance but also don't think it was a good idea wearing a shirt promoting a right wing organization at such an event... Did she want trouble so she would have something to report?
People will just never get over themselves and have a lame excuse to start some shit.
"Fuck the water cannons and tear gas, give the cops AK47s and unlimited hollow point bullets at the G20 summit... These antifa scumfucks are the scum of the earth and don't deserve to breathe free air."
"As soon as protestors begin inciting violence and looting, it's no longer a protest. They become rioters."
"You should talk about the BC wildfires, they're getting pretty crazy and my family's had to evacuate!"
why r people still trying to get dirt on Hillary
fuck blm.
"Jesus Christ stop with the clickbait ""freaking out"" bit in almost every title of your videos. It's as obnoxious as MSM sites using adjectives like ""blasted"" or ""slammed"". It's below you"
"Okay if you think that way what about all the money given to Hilary Clinton from the Middle Eastern Countries!  Millions and 2 digit figure, George Soros money hundreds of millions of dollars, From the Ukraine and the sell of 20% of the US's uranium when Hilary was secretary of state , Clinton Foundation !  I'm just saying it's bad on both!  The DNC never gave the FBI there servers so they could check about Russia being the hackers!  Crowdstrike is the IT company hired by the DNC!  The Ukraine was digging up dirt and George Soro's was as well!  The protesters at the Trump rallies were paid by Soro's!  So Foreign Money and help has been involved!  One thing that Clapper has said and Comey ( bad as he might be) that none  of the votes were changed and the ballot boxes  weren't as well!  Either way Trump still would have won!"
Anyone else sick of this division between liberals and conservatives? were all the same...
love the song see you again. its a beautiful song.
I feel the protesters are causing Gandhi to roll in his grave if you want change turn the other cheek and be the better person
"While I usually like your videos and you usually seem to try to stay neutral it seem to me that you failed this time. With the Trump Jr. story you completely forget to mention that he is not a part of the campaign, has no security clearance and indeed is an adult. Meeting of private persons with other people, foreign or not, to get information about private people is not a crime. Might it be a bit fishy, yes, is it a crime, nope."
"I do believe that an element of ANTIFA over extends and ultimately hurts their arguments, however, going into a hostile crowd with symbols that may incite them isn't just dangerous it's fucking stupid, would you go into a Klan rally with a black lives matter T-shirt?  Would you Walk into Raqqa with something portraying Mohammed? Don't be stupid, stupid."
"On the story about planet of the apes, I have never heard of that guy before, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. it's extremely narsasistic of him to assume it's about him when, to put it frankly, he's not that relevant."
Philip Defranco :)
Philando Castile was told multiple times to not reach. He did. He died.
there is no secret link
"Let me get this straight:

You are running for government office, and someone says ""Hey, I have dirt on your opponent that shows he/she is unfit to lead"" You are not supposed to follow that up?

I mean, I could understand it if they email said ""Hey, we're from the _______ government and we're here to help. What do we have to lie about, sabotage, or who do we have to kill to get you in power?"" In that case, I could see that as collusion or conspiracy. 

For those who disagree, ask yourselves - do you honestly think that Hillary or her staff would have turned that opportunity down if the roles were reversed?"
"Love the show, but I think you should get a more professional set"
"This is just a great example of how the media controls the population. Don Jr. was just trying to hear out the lady, and did the right thing in releasing the emails. If Clinton was approached by Ukraine and said they have info about Trump campaign collusion, I'm sure she would take the meeting and listen to them. The media has done nothing but cover the Don Jr. story, yet this video is the first time I'm hearing about the Ukraine-Clinton thing. We cannot attack Trump while not saying anything about Clinton when they are being accused of similar stuff. We need to unite as a country and stand behind Trump, because even if he gets impeached, we just get Pence, who is as right-wing as they come."
"10:20
So I guess we'll be seeing Hillary being brought up on charges for accepting campaign donations from Saudi Arabia?"
A side story of this is Lauren Southern outed herself as a white nationalist. Lauren has said she is a libertarian (Belief in individual liberties) Identitarianism is the antithesis of this. As identitarianism is the belief in group rights. Lauren is a hypocrite
AHHAHAHAHAH GERMAN FUCKS CALLING PEOPLE NAZIS HAHAHAHAHA PRICELESS
"""We tried to collude! We couldn't figure it out!"" üòÇ"

Those were riots"
I spent the whole first half of the video asking myself who the fuck deray was...
"Who needs to go digging around to find dirt on Clinton, like really"
"Don Jr. willingly reveals potentially shady emails: Media goes nuts
Hillary has god knows how many leaked never intended to be shown: Not a fucking word until it was too late to backpedal.
I'm not saying either side is right, just glaring at the media for it."
I dislike Charley.
"Regardless of what Trumps dumb ass son got it doesn't matter because what he did is against the law. The statute in question is 52 USC 30121, 36 USC 510
""A foreign national shall not, directly or indirectly, make a 
contribution or a donation of money or other thing of value, or 
expressly or impliedly promise to make a contribution or a donation, in 
connection with any Federal, State, or local election."""
"Antifa is riddled with fascists, looters and violent psychos. They are a tragic bunch of losers desperate for attention."
"That should be a shirt ""I am going to smack some tolerance in you!"" LoL"

"Either look into both OR drop the anti-Trump nothingburger. Honestly, this whole thing is stupid, as both political parties are."
"There are no pacific movements which can stay pacific when losing the argument, because if they were reasonable, they would not fight for an unreasonable cause in the first place."
"Through experience one eventually finds out that people who throw word daggers and talk loudly about what other's have done or are doing or are going to do, are trying to deflect attention from themselves because what they are spewing IS what they have done, are doing or will be doing themselves."

"@Philip Defranco....I appreciate what you do, I'm a fan...but you, your editor or research team messed up big with the Donald Trump email story. The way you have represented it in this video, by constantly saying ""and 'insert name here' response was"" completely misrepresents the ACTUAL timeline and who knew what and when.The email excerpts you presented were in the complete reverse order. The order MATTERS, the way you have presented it makes it seem that DT junior had already agreed to the meeting BEFORE being told that it would be with a Russian Gov't Atty or what the meeting was about. The email you present as the final email was in fact the first and made it clear from the BEGINNING of the communications (June 3rd) that Don Jr thought that he would be meeting with a representative of the Russian Government who had information about Clinton and that it was ""high level and sensitive information but was part of Russia and it's governments support for Mr Trump"". I'm sure this was not intentional on your part Phil.....but your presentation of the order of emails creates a false narrative about a serious situation."
Watsky is lit
I will not allow Gangnam Style to be dethroned. I will NOT ALLOW IT.
Generation Identity!
Our world is broken
I heard on the news here (Netherlands) that old RAF people where probably involved. And those guys are simply insane left wing terrorists. And if you don't distance yourself from those guys you don't deserve to be taken serious as a move for positive change.
"1:47 ""He said what now, and I should respect it?..."" LOL i can't stop laughing and idk why"
"This is the narcissism of this generation.  This guy Deray is now saying that HE OWNS all blue vests, anyone in any movie that wears a blue vest now is imitating Deray.  Narcissism anyone?  Then he goes on to say that the ape in this movie apparently has been made to look like him, a human being, homo sapien.  Yet, if a Caucasian were to say or even imply such a thing as that racism would be shouted from the rooftops, for it would be racism to say that a homo sapien man looks like an ape.  But, he said that HE looks like one...in a blue vest, because he owns the rights to all blue vests.  He really should have thought this one over before he typed."
"If Trump Junior gets charged for foreign aid to the campaign, Hillary Clinton is fucked. Saudi contributing 20% of her campaign. Qatar 5%. How many other Middle Eastern countries have donated to her?"
the moment anyone goes to mob mentality or physically or verbally harassing others you're no longer to be taken seriously as you could not respect your cause enough to refrain from performing activities that are outside of the scope of being civil

"Spit on a nazi with words? LOL That's called appeasement bub, don't be part of the problem."
Antifa is a terrorist organisation. Their cause is causing harm and destruction to private property.
"Some of the people in the pictures weren't even there with Lauren, they were just in the picture. One of the people who was assaulted was a journalist from German liberal media. 

While we're on the subject of Nazis, if people are on to calling Tim Pool of all people a Nazi, we're fucked. This ""guilt by association"" shit has went further than I've ever thought possible. People call people fucking Nazis because they openly disagreed in debate with someone who has slightly conservative viewpoints, just talking to them is enough to say, ""Nazi!""."
"Trump Jr. literally committed a felony. Be on the look out for a PARDON from his father, and not a single GOP representative advocating for impeachment."
It's so frustrating when people make these claims about things being racist and whatnot when most often they are not. It reduces the credibility of the movement and sometimes the respect of the public by overreaching and taking offense to subjects that -when researched - are not offensive at all
I am very sad  no secret link of the day :(
"I've been to two Watsky concerts and have been a fan of his since some of his earliest YouTube videos. I've also been a beautiful bastard for almost 5 years now, and I never knew you were a fan of George Watsky! I got to meet and talk with him for over 30 minutes after his Iowa City concert, and I couldn't agree more, he is incredibly nice and a very humble person. PLEASE FIND ANY WAY TO COLLAB WITH HIM!!!!!!"
Its funny cause they said in the email the information would be of value to your father AKA trump. They literally took the words out of the law and we are still debating whether this is illegal or not
What do you mean many people see it as a lie? He said none that were set up and then said yesterday he had a set up meeting with a Russian. It hurts your credibility when you don't call a spade a spade. That's exactly what CNN does. So congrats on that.
guys  I have an issue when I close my eyes I can't see
"We are in a dangerous time. It's sad to see the world falling to the clutches of Communism, have we not looked at history and seen the horror communism created? I can see a war between Communist's, Neo-Nazi's and Fascist's in Europe as unrest continues to grow."
"Tariq Nasheed is like the black version of Richard Spencer with some Roosh V. This guy even made a rap album called Wash Yo Ass; look up King Flex. He's also the dude that called Vidcon a hangout for suspected white supremacists. Holy crap, dude...

Antifa is full of bloodthirsty assholes who doesn't give a rat's ass about private property. There was an Antifa member taking a selfie at Hamburg using an iPhone while others were burning. Does Antifa believe in having belongings or what?"
"That doesn't change anything about the collusion being illegal. If I murder someone who has also commit murder, LEGALLY I HAVE STILL COMMIT MURDER. Investigate all sides to this, but for fucks sake if he is guilty of this, then he should be tried for this."
Congrats Phil on once again being the only news outlet offering a fair and balanced look at hot button issues instead of the rabid chimp screaming offered by both sides of the MSM
lol even black people identify themselves as apes
when your ego is so high that you think everyone is depicting you..
"What really pisses me off is you have ""progressives"" like the young turks who minimize what antifa did during the ""protest"" (riot).

By doing so they are saying, hey we are ok with you acting worse then a bunch of monkeys, we will cover for you so keep it up."
Trump Jr. has a cartoon outy belly button chin.
game of thrones is the getting worse and worse dude... argh what to watch!
Did Donald Trump Jr shoot himself in his father's footsteps?
I don't understand why people support tromp even when there is a scandal but the moment he brings up Hillary you guys go to town on her even though she's not even the fucking president. You guys need to sort out your fucking priorities
"The fact that Trump Jr. was dealing with something like this goes to show that Donald Trump and his ragtag team of heathens he calls a family is JUST as bad as Hillary Clinton, they both screwed up, they both had priorities set in the wrong places, but had good intentions. Both were striving to do good things, but were focused in the wrong areas and doing wrong things to further those points."
information can be of value I mean information Brokers do exist.  I think that the law was violated in this case because he solicited for information that could be a value. and the law clearly states that you cannot solicit.
"So Donald Jr. may have broke the law, after said law is stretched to cover what he did? Ok then is the Piss Dossier breaking the law too? Or it's fine since it was Hillary's thing? I see it as a complete double standard, whatever crap Hillary did was fine, but if a Trump did it they broke the law. Fascist Democrats."
"Dude...

Now I felt the BERN!.... But C'mon!!!! Dude?????   Where is in ANY universe these to things even comparable?     I said my piece, you can go back to ignoring me now."
Yeah I know you are trying to be fair here Phil but wearing and Identitarian shirt in Germany is like wearing a confederate flag in Philly or Brooklyn.  You aren't making a statement.  You are being an asshole and trying to light fires.  How much tolerance can you give someone who is wearing dark history on their shirt that is there just to piss you off?
Fuck BLM if they see themselves as dirty apes than that is what they are. BLM are a bunch of cunts. They are just disgustingly ghetto people. You get the same shit class of people in all nations even in the region of Asia.... You cure antifa with lead. lots and lots of lead. Also the left don't have arguments and hate people who actually have things. They just want to destroy everything. They are scum that needs to be trampled by a iron boot.
Antifa are terrorists

I saw my bae Lauren Southern in the thumbnail
I'm black and I think BLM people are complete idiots.......
It actually sounds like the Ukrainian info that was offered to the DNC is info regarding this Trump Jr. meeting. It's very possible Russia was playing both sides during the election.
His comment was irresponsible and that is unforgivable.
"I love how he says these empty platitudes that are so generic they're rendered meaningless as though they are insightful wisdom for our generation. 

This guy is so aggressively mediocre it hurts."
"The ""of value"" part of the argument could hold up here.  Information is bought and sold all the time, like Internet metadata or the sale of debt to collection companies.  Perhaps before it wouldn't hold up, but with information being a commodity itself now, it could hold up to scrutiny."
Phil I would like to thank you for deleting that ignorant comment condoning racism. Racism should not be tolerated no matter who it is coming from or directed at.
"""We tried to collude, but we couldn't figure it out?!"" üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"The cause of AntiFa is exactly what they did in Germany; To loot, to instill fear and to physically assault people who do not agree with their side of the argument. It doesn't hurt their cause as it is their cause to divide. It's a political move, and thus AntiFa should be classified as a domestic terrorist organization as soon as possible. It's not just in Germany or the USA."
"Uh oh Phil, your description says ""Main lobster"" as in

""Well I'm comfortable playing a tank or healer, but I usually main lobster.""

"C'mon guys, let's get Gangnam Style back to number 1!"
"I mean, if with this they find something, let them do it, the legal system should prosecute him, and as you said, they should also check the Hillary front here. If both parties are proven to be colluding, then neither are fit for the government, so maybe a third party will step up or something, time for change. However my main problem here is that if we go to FB or other social media and mention the Hillary thing, they'll either defend Hillary or say it doesn't matter now. Well it does matter, it means BOTH parties were colluding, so it means that BOTH parties must be drained."
I really feel like there are going to be alot of people in this administration who face federal charges.
Liberals are not happy unless they offended by someone on something.
"Even that BLM guy agrees he was wrong by deleting the tweet..

antifa are actually fascists
Yeah Phil for sure pronounce him name right mate
"No Phil, Deray's silly tweet should not hurt the cause at all. Black lives matter is about equality in the eyes of the law and a tweet about a movie shouldn't affect that. Phil you're not as ""neutral"" as you try to pretend to be."
antifa.
"Seriously, fuck ANTIFA. The stuff they've been doing is not remotely acceptable."
"Look, even if Donald Jr. was told the Russians had incriminating evidence against the Clintons, he STILL should not have met with them. Like, what did Al Gore do when he was sent a dossier supposedly containing info against George Bush? He handed it straight to the authorities. That's what you're supposed to do. Besides, what kind of fucking idiot trusts Putin's cronies???"
"Just to let you know. Islamic takeover of Britain.

9:03 Jerry Seinfeld impersonation lol
so just cause they gave a ape a blue vest its racist? in the original they have sterotype apes as a symbolism theyre the same as us like they have emotions and personalitys.

Lauren is pretty fit though
"I've legit never heard of that song. When Gangnam Style was blowing up, everrryyyone and their mothers was talking about it. Kind of odd."
But Phil what if I'm an ugly bastard
Too bad those nazis got away.
"Not only are the Antifa retards hurting their own cause but they aren't even attacking nazis. There is a shit trend going around where 'progressives' label those who dare to disagree as bigots, alt-right, nazis, facists, white nationalists, and so on. Tim Pool is a liberal libertarian, Lauren Southern is a conservative but far from a nazi, from what I have seen of WeAreChange Luke is at the very least left leaning, and max was a local reporter for a liberal media outlet. However their actual political orientation doesn't seem to matter, all that matters is that they even question progressive rhetoric.

Also, ironic that Antifa declare themselves anti-fascist while their policing of thought crimes is more akin to fascism than those they choose to demean and vilify."
#shutuptariq
"So tired of the Alt-Right. So tired of Antifa. Both think they're fighting the righteous fight for a righteous cause. Both think they have the monopoly on truth.

It doesn't make anything better."

"POTApes guy was reaching for a gold bar, found a soggy turd....  Watsky is awesome."
Lauren southern is a fucking idiot. simple
Whats your thoughts on Lauren's content? I personally enjoy what she talks about and stands for. Maybe if people weren't so easily offended we can actually have a conversation about the shit that goes on in the world.
Always hysteria about Trump it is getting to the point people tune out what Trump is supposed to have done.
y is trump still in power when everyone knows he payed for the win
"5:53 Thinking ""If its ""It's Everyday Bro"" by Jake Paul, am going to burn this place to the fucking GROUND!""You all most gave me a heart attack Phil"
"Honestly Phil, if people are looking for the worse people to argue against tolerance and far right ideals then then they're obviously aren't willing to have a confersation to begin with. For example, let's pretend that I was arguing against  Trump so  say  that Trump is bad and point to the worse of his supporters. It wouldn't be representive of reality and facts. This whole thing of ""this hurts you're argument"" is scapegoating. As people we need to look at the whole not the sum of its parts  

Just because some far right bigoted people get hurt doesn't bolster their argument. Their arguments are still trash but who ever does the hitting is wrong"
First!
No secret link?
i've never heard that song
"So basically Russia has been helping us see how crooked our presidential candidates are.
If only we could return the favor."
"Phil, you are wrong. There were literally hundreds of protesters who were not peaceful protesters, but instead were literally burning the city down. Don't close your eyes man. This was Germany's Antifa in action. And yes, they are kind of being nazis themselves man."

"Lets be honest though... congrats to Wiz and Charlie, but your record wont hold"
"On the issue of collusion: 1) There is a stark difference between ""Clinton allies"" and Trump's son who is actively working on his campaign. The definition of ""allies"" would need to be more clearly defined here in order to prove it wasn't just some random Clinton supporter, and was an active working member of the campaign. It is only against campaign laws for working members of the campaign to accept assistance and information like this from foreign nationals/governments. 2) Seeking out help from foreign nationals is different than the foreign nationals trying to seek out you. That is, Don Jr (as an official part of his father's campaign) accepting the meeting with a known foreign national under the pretense of gaining disparaging info which could affect election results is different than a foreign national having disparaging information and coming to the Clinton campaign, who we don't know and currently have no record of taking said information or meeting. That is the biggest difference. Right now we have definitive proof of one happening, and for the other, just an article. This is also just a pathetic distraction technique. Even if the Clinton campaign is liable for something, that doesn't make what you did right or legal.

Seems to me it may be an ignorance thing. They weren't aware that receiving that kind of information from foreign nationals would be considered illegal, or at least shady. But then I keep going back to why hide it? If they didn't know it was wrong, they wouldn't have lied and gone through the efforts to hide the meetings. That's where you make yourself look guilty and like you knew what you were doing was wrong."
I still don't understand why Clintons can meet with Russians and its a non issue but any Trump association is fully investigated..wouldnt it be interesting if the Clintons caused all of this to make Trump look bad during the election? But our investigators were just too late finding the info
The planet of the apes one makes me sad as a black person.
I got to meet Watsky and talked to him during his tour and i loved him on sourcefed when he visited table talk etc. Watsky is a great artist and person in general. Saw him election night as well. üíö it was so cool when he was on SF. He's my fave.
"Hey Phil! Do you think these people who attack others who disagree with them is a learned behavior from governments who start wars with countries who disagree with them just on a different scale? Just a thought, would love to here yours.  Love the show and the vlog!"

"I think the ape think is dumb. It's the color blue and a jacket. IN THE SNOW! It was cold and the monkeys gotta do what they gotta do, chill."
"The Facts Are:
1.	There is both a Russian and a Democratic connection to this story the Left doesn't want to talk about. 
2.	The Kremlin-connected lawyer that met with Trump Jr. is Veselnitskaya who is associated with Fusion GPS. 
3.	Fusion GPS is the opposition research firm hired by the DNC to compile the FAKE dossier produced by former British spy Christopher Steele. 
4.	Fusion GPS was paid by a Democrat ally of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs to conduct the research. 
5.	This was another attempt at a set-up, with direct connections to the DNC. 
6.	Both the Fake Dossier & this meeting were total failures for the dirty shenanigans of the DNC.
7.  Alexandra Chalupa was/is an operative of the Clinton teamed who met with the Ukrainian government to try and dig up dirt on Trump & his team, with hopes of provoking Congress into holding a hearing before the election about Russian contact with the Trump campaign. ...which was another dirty shenanigan failure."
The whole world must learn of our peaceful ways! By Force!
ANTIFA TERRORISTS
"how is it that the ""protest"" if it could be called that, in Germany is not already illegal? if you had a bunch of people in black with masks on and weapons in hand burning cars and other private property, how could Germany not paint them all with the same brush as any other destructive criminals?"
Fucking blacks are getting worse. Always looking for something to cry about. No wonder people laugh at the BLM movement. (meaning the BLM movement) not all them.
I feel like Tariq Nasheed is getting too much screen time.
DeRay was projecting.
Please don't destroy the EU while you 2 juggernauts (US and RUSSIA) wage war.
Occasionally I feel like a terrible person because I find myself unable to listen to the actual news because I find Phillip's voice so soothing
"G20 deserves a few more words. The city war BURNING, engulfed in thick smoke. There are photos comparing it to war zones. Hamburg looks worse. Just look at some videos shot by locals from their windows and balconies. It really looks like war with police nowhere to be seen anywhere but around the summit."
Philip throwing subtle shade a Tariq
What position does Don Trump Jnr hold in the US goverment?
You put Deray before trump admitting to treason? Your priorities.
i love charlie puth
"2 wrongs don't make a right, 3 rights make a left and 2 wrights made a plane."
Floyd Mayweather won the first press conference
I don't give a shit if you protest. Do what you what. What I do care about is whining bitches who would rather burn cars a loot the actually do something that would make change. Honestly that's not a protest. That's a riot.
At¬†9:03 Phil turns into Jerry Sieifeld¬†for a couple of seconds.
"""kimmy kimmel live"" whoops someone needs to fix that typo...but great show!"
"I wonder how many times you will have to say, don't over reach to support your cause because in return, you will always hurt it. Like that is %100 true."
"At this point I don't give a shit about the Russia stuff,... the media has cried wolf too many times. BLM makes me embarrassed to be human, they have to bully the LGBTQS$U1¬•zZz1+1=3 movement now because nobody else cares."
No but 3 rights make a left!
"Trump Jr. didn't solicit anything. Solicit specifically implies on has to have requested something. Trump Jr. didn't request for this meeting, the meeting was proposed to him, to which he responded in acceptance. Though, a semantic argument from me, I think the biggest issue here is that we cannot provide reasonable evidence that Trump Jr. acted on behalf of his father, or his father's campaign. The interaction seems to only interact with Trump Jr. as an individual, not as an extension of the campaign."
I think Hollywood should have been more sensitive.  Comparing Deray to that ape is insulting to the ape.
I hate the entire Trump family.
"More like, Deray Same Damn VestüòÇ"
If the Hillary and the Trump campaign colluded with a foreign government there is a BIG difference between the two cases Donald J Trump is the president of the United States Hillary isn't.
Where's the secret link!?
5:23 Kimmy Kimmel Live :D
Yet another day I agree with every word!
McGregor or Mayweather
Hey Phil where'd you get those blue lights from? They're super cool!
i zoned out for this whole episode
Did Deray call himself an Ape by saying he fells he's being compared to an ape?  I mean if he's pissed that it looks like him than that's on him and his self image.
"Sometimes I am slightly afraid that Phil leans slightly too much to 'alternative (rightwing) news', but everytime there is a genuinely big story I am very happy to see that Phil takes an objective stance. It's great episodes like this that make me trust Phil more, and make me look at my own position again if I disagree with Phil. Of course I still won't always agree, but this makes me confident that Phil does genuinely try to be neutral, and usually does a good job."
I'm truly convinced Deray McKesson and Tariq Nasheed don't even believe the claims they make about racism. They're using situations to their advantage much like Rev. Al Sharpton has done in the past. They're profiting from outrage culture. They are doing more to hurt race relations than they are of fixing them.
I love new segments üòÅ
*G20 Riots

So it's illegal to get REALLY information from Russia? The Democrats are just crying because they got told on!
"I feel this is making something out of nothing. Like we are just going out of our way to make everything about the BLM movement. PLANET OF THE APES FIRST CAME OUT IN 1968!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How in the hell has that one and ALL the other sequels since been about the Black Lives Matter Movement?! This was a very selfish assumption; as if he is on our mind every second of every day in every little thing we do. The blue vest? Are you serious? It's selfish and bullshit. I'm tired of it. Are you going to protest Philip DeFranco's profile picture too and make it about you?

If you want America to listen to your movement, then portray it in a manner that we can take you seriously! When the BLM movement first started, I was ALL about listening to African Americans, their voices, their facts, and their stories. I stopped listening because of shit like this. I WANT equality for you too but I can't take you fucking seriously. I don't work well with such self-involved people either.

What REALLY pisses me off is how this affects other innocent individuals in the BLM movement. To elaborate, I just said I don't want to listen anymore because of shit like this; but how is that fair to the other human beings that are part of the BLM movement? Not every single BLM advocate is like what Deray has portrayed. Some others have ACTUAL real stories of racism committed against them but then idiots like this guy helps to squash their voice despite being on the same side. He ruins it for them! Knock that shit off Deray and take a vacation. Let someone else take over to try and bring the positive message of the BLM movement back to the forefront as opposed to what you're making it into."
WHERE THE SECRET LINK AT PHIL
"( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) no secret link. I see your true color, Phil."
"monkeys would be offended to be compared to this guy
#monekylivesmatter"
"Honestly, whose more racist? A person who makes a movie about talking apes, or a person who looks at the movie about talking apes and says ""YO! Das me!""."
"cheeky German wankers calling innocent people Nazis, how regressively fascist"
Black lives matter is a hate movement
Sieg heil
"Its amazing that the guy thought a blue vest meant something in planet of the apes, that guy needs to just stop tweeting, like forever"
That ape is not DeRay Mckesson because ape is way smarter that this brainwashed BLM idiot.
I HATE the new sound the comment make when you like them
Where did the secret link go?
Some people go to protests only to have an excuse to be violent.
"DeFranco is Anti-Antifa! He's a confirmed Alt-Right, Neo-Nazi, Xenophobe! #PedophiliaIsTheFuture #Daddy0FiveDidNothingWrong #TransTodayPedoTomorrowLGBTTQQAAIPP4Life"
Some people just try way to hard to be offended
"I think you have to understand that people are scared because of these new movement sand people do stupid shit out of fear, sam e way nazi's killed jews, people attack identity politics because of marginalisation and fear."
"I've noticed Phil has alot of ""People are FREAKING OUT"" in his video titles. And I can see why, almost every fucking episode. I swear, my last hope for humanity is dissapearing VERY quickly with all this shit going on around the world."
"somme one should make a protest/riot type gear for the civillians, like some forearmguards shin gaurds ,knee guard ,some sort of gas mask, maybe a vest that could reduce the impact of say being trampled, or shot with beanbag guns or rubber bullets"
you should've mentioned the police taht would shout and beat the shit out of anyone they want
Good to see Phillip's chronic neck pain is doing better.
"Wow antifa considered peaceful? No wonder you get death threats 

I've been watching you since like what 07 - 08?  

The fuck happened to you that you're such a cuck?"
Idk who derray(dur ray) is but I do know who Deray (Dee Ray)
"I can predict exactly how the Trump Jr thing works out. 1. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens. 2. If charges does come up against him, daddy will swoop in and pardon baby hands jr."
It's purely just a easter egg reference to the original movie.
Was Techno Viking at the protest?  He'd crush all the police who try to stop him from marching
"So, what you're saying is....


Lock THEM up!"
The blue ape vest reminds me of the little girl in red in Schindler's List. Maybe that's just me.
I don't get why people want to make things racist when there is no connection between a item and racism. Just seems like attention seeking
"I think it's safe to declare the ""horseshoe theory"" as Fact"
"Im black and I just facepalmed into oblivion...sorry everyone

"I still think Psy is more impressive because 1) he didn't need any features, 2) he didn't need a famous actor to die to gain sympathy for his song, and 3) far less people speak Korean than English globally so it is much harder to go viral."
No secret link?
"DeRay is a snitch, for those of y'all who don't know. He relays info back to the FBI."
Koreans UNITE!! Make Psy #1 again!
The protest wouldn't have been violent if antifa was acknowledged as the terrorist organization it is.
So far that Trump story is a nothing burger.
BLM back at it again with the pedantic arguments.
"Antifa is an organization based around violence and intimidation, they are only slightly below what I consider terrorist and thus should be treated as the scum they are."
"Why is this russia stuff still news? Why are we even talking about it? We've been fucking with russia for the last 60 years. Of course they've been fucking with us as well. I'm getting really sick of this russia stuff. How long are we going to be outraged over other governments colluding with our politics when we've been doing it directly for such a long time. Or does Iraq, Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan, Libya, Columbia, and many others not count?"
Yep that ape looks like Deray........oh wait no that ape has a twitter..
"Philip, I normally wouldn't argue the importance of pronouns but Lauren Southern is legally a man."
Lmaooooo planet of the apes is racist?... Fucking really...
I don't believe the ligitimacy of the views of that wiz khalifa music video. It's nowhere near as globally known as gangam style was.
"i want everyone who reads this to go and count how many videos out of a week he has put ""people are freaking out"" in the title"
BLM is a joke and Antifa is just as bad. Far left Liberals are ruining everything. Europe is falling apart and I only hope America will wake up.
Antifa are the real fascists today. Lock them up in the same cell as some nazis and let the idiots have a go at each other away from the rest of humankind.
I don't understand. What did Lauren's top represent (what political view)?
"For God""s sakes people. Get your eyes off this Russian BS.It is only a distraction while the thieves pick our pockets. Drain the swamp."
black lives matter is still a thing?
"I'm surprised people are surprised at the Don Jr story... it's called politics, it's a sleazy business."
i agree with both the planet of the apes and the black dude cuz he deleted his tweet so i think we should just forget about it he made a mistake get over it.

"@7:50 ""many people are saying this is a lie""

This is the problem. It is a lie, a blatant lie. But in our world now, apparently people can just yell ""FAKE NEWS"" at something and it becomes not real to them."
"Nothing on Omar Khadar yet Phil? It'll come, and when it does, I hope you tell the ENTIRE story. You typically do."
"The cocaine analogy is great because it also shows how this e mail chain proves nothing.

If you and your family have been accused of deug use and somebody approaches you with O got some cocaine wanna hang and you then meet. That doesn't mean anything really. It has no moral content because it is still a ""but what if she had brought"" and ""he could have snitched on her"" back and forth.

Such is the problem with hypotheticals.

And saying you can't accept information from foreign governments because of a law governing campaign contribution is ridiculusly pedantic?"
"The no shin family, gotta love it."
"Hey Phil, it would be helpful if you actually told us what ""Identitarian"" meant, i was confused throughout that whole story what was going on."
"Why does John Cena need to go undercover, no one can't see him anyways."
I don't know if this is a big story or not but the footage of the town hall meeting where the whole Humongous thing happened got released which showed more details. H3H3 made a video about it
"Plain and simple the Russian Government interfered with our election.....both sides....that's the issue. We have to continue the narrative on both sides and find out how much we are to blame for not watching out for the corruption of our ""elected"" officials."

"It should be ""Youtubers"" not ""Youtuber's""."
Anfifa are scum
"I don't get the American's on this issue, you seem to be focusing on trying to prove information came from the Russians when in the end it should have no influence on the end decision you come from using the information and i feel a lot of people think that if they can prove the leaks came from the Russians it somehow invalidates said information and conclusions drawn from that information. You keep talking about how the Russians hacked Hillary and supplied the trump campaign with information but none of you are debating the authenticity of the information, which means you do indeed agree that it's true. I don't really give a damn where the information comes from as long as the information is correct and allows me to make a more informed decision. Moreover, it's Hillary's fault for having poor security that such things occurred in the first place, she is only more to blame. Would, somehow, the information be more correct if it came from a private citizen in the US rather than the Russians?

I do agree that it's concerning that there may have potentially been Russian hacking of important information but i think people forgot that the US government also uses such methods, as-well-as most governments around the world (china for example).


ps. if you disagree i wrote another comment down below so before you comment read that too"
"I'm genuinely curious why Donald Trump Jr. shared an email which literarally proves that he knew that the Russian government was behind the information, and that the Russian government tried to interfere with the election. It just seems so incredibly idiotic."
Antifa are an anarchist terror group that uses the word 'nazi' to justify their disgusting acts to the wider public and need to be treated as such.
Planet of the Apes triggers me because there's an ape wearing a blue vest
This IS their cause. This is Antifa. This is what they do. This is what they always have done. Thay are domestic terrorists. Nothing less.
"ok but just to play devil's advocate for the deray story, one of the apes was wearing a jacket that said, ""the only good ape is a dead ape."" which for those who don't know, is a reappropriation of a racist phrasing used in the south and by racial hate groups that would go ""the only good black man/n*gger is a dead black man/n*gger."""
um the shooting was just do you not look up court rulings?
9:03 Since when is Phil Jerry Seinfeld? xD
"Does Trump Jr. Look like Tommy from GTA Vice City to anyone else? No, okay"
Well I'm not a legal expert but it does seem like Don Jr. did have the intent to receive a contribution which had an intangible value or intrinsic value from an accounting standpoint. Where some experts do not believe this information falls in this category I do because campaign donations of a liquid nature would contribute to the promotion of a candidate through advertisements and airtime ect.... This contribution of information would act in a similar way if valid and utilized it would have helped promote that candidate and once used one could calculate a value by how many voters were influenced by this information.
yeah lets bash peace into people's heads with baseball bats and (my personal favourite) SLEDGEHAMMERS!

"Antifa are ligit psychopaths, I they say they want their voices heard and and they are protesting... Then they raid stores, beat people up, damage property...

"Nothing will happen to them.  Trump and his family have had their illegal behavior brought to light multiple times already, and nothing was done.  Trump Sr. can claim he had no knowledge of the meeting, because the first email states they hadn't told him about it.  They'll all get off on a technicality this time.  Even when there is clear evidence of wrongdoing, Congress won't do anything to stop him.  It's a ridiculous, exhausting circle."
#Planetoftheapes keep screaming wolf and soon the wolf will hear you and no one will pay attention.
thanks for the extra  5 minutes  <3
Was that a swipe at Charlie Puth? I mean 3 years isn't that long considering gangnam style has been out for even longer lol
If you start rioting where the biggest world leader are your gotta expect a large anti riot movement by police to dispatch you
"And again Phil celebrates YouTube becoming like everything else while I lament the death of YouTube's identity. YouTube is huge, but our YouTube is dead."

"They say it is racist because in the past blacks were called apes. Now he is someone giving light to it, solely because of a word used to hurt his feelings that has nothing to do with black people at all, except the fact that you are race baiting trash. It's really good for your movement too when you come off like that.

Hollywood is racist because they have no blacks in the Oscars, then now they are racist because of a movie about apes and according to this guy, black people are apes so they are the racist and not him for the link of the two HE made.. AND HE (a nobody) WAS TARGETED BECAUSE AN 'APE' WAS WEARING A VEST THAT IS THE SAME COLOUR AS HIS."
"On the G20 story, and similar protest stories, I think I see what is 
going on. The problem lies that, these days we have an overflow of 
information that we can no longer process, only react. Information 
overload is actually  a real thing and affects quite a lot of people. 
Look at how things were twenty, ten, eight years ago: Yes, there has 
always been a number of misguided extremist in every aspect of life, but
 these days the number of people like that is even more. And there's 
only so much we can process when we get story, after story, after 
breaking news, after breaking news of the already broken news, after 
scandal, after scandal, after hit piece, after hit piece, after opinion 
article/blog/vlog/channel, after fake news disseminated by news 
outlets/government officials/bloggers, after post after post in social 
media... After so much, we can't handle it, we can only react."
"So we have:
-Stupidity A
-Stupidity B
-Stupidity C

yep"
Imagine if all those cops just opened fire and layed downed all of those Antifa pricks
"Thanks for your analyses of the Trump Jr story! I'm grateful to get an unbiased discussion of the events. 

So many outlets are clearly biased in favor of one side or the other. When looking at the news, I know that regardless of the story's merit, certain outlets are going to say this is no big deal, and others are going to scream bloody murder. There's also a lot of distortion and misreporting that comes from all sides. 

You're one of a select number of people that I trust to report the news fairly. Thanks for being so awesome!"
Can we start a new religion? The Gospel of DeFranco.... The religion of opinions and mature debates
Ah antifa..... literally the opposite of their name XD
the surprising thing about the Trump story is that he would be so stupid as to put that in an email
look how liberals behave
This is why Europe needs a second amendment. Citizens would be able to defend themselves and their property from these communists.

Deray aka Tariq Jr is just another version of Traiq Nasheed.  And BLM is just another black supremacy group like the Black Panther Party and is no better then those organizations or the white supremacy organizations that they hate.
Clinton accepted $12 million from the king of Morocco
"Phil, you might be happy about Charlie Puth's video beating out Psy's for most popular video, but the KPop fan in me is dying so much inside right now... ;.;"
I might be a little out of the loop but why are people protesting the G20 summit? Is it not the world leaders coming together to improve shit? Who would protest that?
Liked for watsky
all these people are fucking stupid
Why would someone willing compare themselves to an ape? WTF? Who jumps to that conclusion what is going on in your head?
We have been lied to by politicians since the beginning of time. Obama and Hillary more than any. I don't give a shit about what Donald trump jr did. It's fucking stupid let's get fucking on with the show.
Hilarious
Dee-ray. Not Durr-ray.
Why can't people be civil and bring violence to the argument
"McKesson doesn't own all blue vests, but he does appear to own self-anointed victimhood!"
Why do you have to be so rational and intelligent Philip DeFranco.  You disgust me.  [Being Sarcastic your awesome :)]
didnt BLM call dabbing the new Hitler Salute???
"Hillary literally breaks the law by having classified information on her personal email account. then lies under oath saying that none of it was labeled as ""classified""

The left:  IT'S ONLY A BIG DEAL BECAUSE SHE'S A WOMAN! RACIST, RACIST, SEXIST, NAZI'S!!!!


Donald Trump Jr. talks to a Russian who says they have dirt on hillary Clinton (No surprise there) and then proceeds to talk about other stuff not related.

The left: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!?! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! RUSSIAN COLLUSION! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!


now the only question i have. are they going to keep this shit up for the next 8 years? or are they going to stop? i mean hell, i'm okay if they start this shit back up when he gets re elected, but fuck me, wait till then for fuck sakes."
Apes take over and overtime evolution turns them human
Congrats to Charlie Puth! A great musician who came from a humble YouTube beginning :)
Both campaigns tried to get help from foreign governments to smear the other candidate. The thing is that almost no media talks about Clinton's attempt but the Trump attempt is blowing up.
Today my birthday and it been a great day
"When your identity becomes wrapped up in being persecuted or oppressed, you start to see persecution and oppression everywhere.  You can see this everywhere, from groups based around social issues that actually do matter, down to inconsequential shit, like which movies and games people like."

"If you think Southern is a Nazi, then you are a moron."
To everyone who reads this I hope you all have a great day
"Identitarians? Really?  -smdh  

Could we possibly divide people into little labeled boxes anymore than we are today?"
CAN SOMEONE SOLVE THE DAM RUBIKS CUBE IN THE BACK PLEASE
Why do protesters destroy property in their own hometown/city? So you are angry at someone so let's destroy our own stuff because we are angry!
THAT SHADE TOWARDS TARIQ IM DYING
Does anyone else not give a shit how many violent protesters were hurt?
Keep chasing those Russian phantoms. It's going great for the MSM
"When do we not ""just jump into it""?"
"For some reason the ""We tried to collude, but we just couldn't figure it out!"" bit really tickled me."
WAAH! WHY CAN'T ALL PROTESTERS BE NON-VIOLENT???!!! WHY CAN'T THEY DEBATE NAZIS??? Fucking kill all Nazis!
"Deray, here's some advice: don't be stupid, stupid."
"wait, planet of the apes is about apes?"
"They are apes.... intelligent apes..... THAT MUST MEAN THEY ARE BLACK PEOPLE
Logic everyone! :D"
"When you make every little thing about racism, I believe it makes people numb to it! There are REAL people losing there lives because of racism, that's what we need to be talking about! Not a damn cgi ape in a movie."
BLM continues to set race relations back rather than furthering the cause.
"With all these protests, there are just people who want to fight, who want to destroy things and will use any excuse they can to do that. With a big event like G20 they will obviously flock to that place to enjoy spreading chaos. I don't really think they care about hurting the cause. They just want to destroy and fight. 

I think the basics of it is no different than the hooligans, who cause havoc because ""OMG YOU LIKE ANOTHER TEAM!"" We have yearly problems when two particular soccer teams meet for a match and it usually ALWAYS cost the police tons of man hours to keep these idiots from destroying themselves and each other."
"I don't think this Russian meeting story will really change anything for the Trump administration. I think lawyers will have a tough time proving that information can be considered ""items of value"" under this law. And even so, I don't think Trump himself will be able to be wrapped into this. It's going to take hell of a lot cleaner evidence to convince a Republican controlled House to impeach a Republican president. 

That being said, at this point Trump's reputation is so tarnished by this whole Russia thing that it doesn't matter whether or not anything is ever proven. Enough people believe it that it doesn't have to be true. This will be his legacy. This is what will be written in the history books."
"Antifa is doing such a good job of convincing people that they are ""in the right"" that they got themselves¬†recognized as a domestic terrorism organization in NJ. Lol"
"no, others set  the meeting , Jr didn't  solitict"
"Why does Phil cover shit like what Deray says? He was wrong, who cares, move on. There is real shit happening."
"Today in ""People with too much damn freetime on their hands"" news..."
"Didn't the Hillary camp solicit a foreign government for op research on Trump (the potty dossier from a French intelligence agent?) Obviously, that's not to say that makes what Don Jr did ok but I thought part of the take away from the potty dossier was that this is common behavior in politics and it doesn't violate any laws. Am I wrong about the dossier thing? What am I missing?"
"Antifa has always boiled my blood. They aren't protesters, they are riot makers. They show up in all black with sticks ready to fight. Best example is the battle for Berkeley."
fuck antifa.
"Make a ""My word is not gospel"" shirt"
"Phil, why are you so supportive of modern day protesting and large masses of people getting together for a 'cause'? I'm genuinely curious."
Kill antifa
Hypocrisy! Gotta love it.
Surprise Phil haven't said anything about the report that the files from the DNC were copied locally
"""preaching tolerance with your fists"" band name!!"
"So Saudi Arabia funding like 1/3 of Hillary's campaign is legal, but not getting anything from a Russian lawyer is a crime?  ._.  Tf is this world..."
"Maybe I am missing something, but I think Clinton and trump are in the clear, since the law says ""a foreign national shall not‚Ä¶"" A condition of the law neither of them fulfills"
"This is hilarious. People are trying SO HARD to be victims. That ape doesn't look like Deray, he does not own blue vests and the fact he's reaching so far to try to rile people up... it's so insane how much people seemingly want to be oppressed nowadays... I guess it's called the regressive left for a reason."
"I just find it stupid that they have an ape wearing clothes. It's an animal. Outside of rich white chicks with their dogs, who puts clothes on animals?"
I guess it's better for Trump Jr. to release things before the media twists the facts. He wanted to have control over how the story was going to be told. I don't feel like he would have released that email if he knew it was going to harm his cause.
I'm a bit confused as to how the Trump Jr. situation was not obvious yesterday?
Kimmy Kimmel Live?
ANTIFA are fascists in everything but name
Anyone happen to know where i can get the cool lamps behind Phil?
Anime is a good art
But Science has proven Deray kind of right... he is genetically closer to a monkey than all other races. Fuck you snowflakes... I want to see you all dead.
"personally i find massively detrimental for you to lump in antifa and black block as part of the protesting left. i agree that protesting is fine and a way to show your voice but these people have no interest of having a protest antifa and black block simply go to these event dressed in black attire, wearing black masks and ready to start a riot and the way they get away with it is they pretend to be part of us. there are videos out there of atifa member taking off their clothes as soon as they realise the fire is lit and the riot is on it's way. these people need to be labeled for what they are and not be protected by the people who do/support peaceful protest."
This is a topical Antifa thing to attack people who don't agree with them they are militant leftists that have to be stopped.
I have lost all sympathy for antifa. I would be hard pressed to feel bad if these lunatics gets themselves killed by police.
"I went to the premiere of War of the Planet of the Apes last night in NYC (my company does business with 20th century fox), and that character is wearing the vest because he grew up in a zoo around humans. Not an attempt to show black ppl as apes lmao y'all too much"
"*Someone beats me up, and calls me a fascist Nazi
Me: Not an argument"
"Its kind of ironic to see antifa act exactly like hitlers brownshirts from the 20s and 30s. The fact they dont realise that they are acting like nazis while hunting supposed ""nazis"" is baffling to me."
The problem with Trump... is that even if we were to find a smoking gun. One so massive that he is just instantly dragged out of the white house... That just leaves the next in line of a whole lot of shit candidates... next in Line Mike Pence. Then Paul Ryan.... Then and i say this every ounce of horror one someone from Utah who has dealt with this lying ass for years... Orin Hatch. Hell we don't even get to someone some what acceptable till #4 on the list... Rex Tillerson... And to be honest would need to get well past #20 before we got someone good.
"It actually looks like See You Again is on track to be surpassed by Despascito (the good, non-Bieber version)."
"FUCK NAZIS
FUCK THE KKK
FUCK ANTIFA
FUCK THE BLACK BLOC"
I get why you have to talk about Donald trump related news but I've just started finding it so boring and uninteresting. Although It could be because I feel somewhat removed from it because I don't live in America
"Thx for covering what happened to me, FYI the reporter sent the photos to antifa and worked for a MSM company that since fired him for this"
Isnt blue prostate cancer?
"Phils word IS gospel and if anyone wants to say otherwise I'm ready to Fuckin throw down!!!! 






Please don't hurt me... ;__;"
"""Other thing of value.""  Pretty vague and debatable for a written law.  Maybe someone should define that phrasing.  Trump lawyers could argue ""other thing"" refers to something with monetary value.  Other lawyers could argue that information to try and take down an opponent is a pretty valuable thing."
"""WHY ARE PEOPLE FREAKING OUT ABOUT THIS""...  Im glad to see Phil is trying out some new titles for his videos. I was starting to think he used the same one everyday."
Where's the secret link? I feel betrayed!
How exactly is behaving as a Nazi an effective anti-Nazi strategy? Also why does preserving traditional national culture and accepting those from other cultures have to be mutually exclusive?
"If you're looting stores and assaulting people, you are not a protester. You are a rioter, end of story. Don't legitimize these thugs by calling them protesters."
"Some black people do look very similar to apes, but that's the reality of it.
But there are many who do not have the traits that could be considered ""Monkey -ish""
Its a movie about talking and walking apes obviously they are going to look like people.
I am half black myself (which has nothing to do with my statement, but it would lessen the hate comments from people calling me racist)"
"We tried to collude, we couldn't figure it out! 
That was great"
Obviously the trump campaign was much better at collusion than Hillary's campaign.
DeRay is a fucking racist.
Whats identitarian (sp)
"Tariq and Deray are the racists since they were the ones who assumed the apes were like black people. when I saw them, all I saw was just monkeys with guns, not BlackLivesMatter. gotta love the dipshits making themselves the victim of something that clearly isn't there"
What happened to sexy ass bahama mama of the day?
Why'd he say homage without the H?
"People hurting their cause by overextending. In the case of Antifa, this is their cause. It IS their cause to have a violent revolution. They like to think themselves socialist revolutionaries. This is why they engage in domestic terrorism, and please can someone tell me how attacking shop owners is helping the proletariat?"
"Acquiring dirt on someone elses corruption is corruption? I don't quite understand that one, but regardless information doesn't not have a legal value unless associated with trade (so Coca Cola's secret formula would be an example of information with a monetary value) this info may hold some value but it is not monetary and thus not applicable."
"You should team up with wearechange, ive followed Luke Radasoski for a year now and he really does care about reporting its all free and he makes sure his audience is informed"
"all I know is, now I cannot get free shit from a foreign government..........cause, I am in the know!"
"Phil! Please watch the Netflix movie ""What the Health""."
Phil you read those emails backwards
It looks more and more like the Left is just slinging shit at anyone connected to Trump to see if anything sticks. It is sad and pathetic. If you don't like Trump being president so much next election vote for someone else(if he even runs for a second term).
praise be our Savior Philip DeFranco
Sorry Phill but for once I'm not having a fantastic Tuesday
"It's funny when you say it hurts ""their cause"" because we assume they're saying the truth when they preach anti facism and that they are fighting for equality. It is obvious that their cause has turned into rioting, looting, and assaulting people with different beliefs. I would argue that they are just showing their true colors, not hurting ""their cause."""
Damn commies

"I don't intend to defend any of the despicable things antifa retards did last weekend, but damn, Lauren Southern must be a special kind of stupid to wear that shirt to protests were literally extremist antifa types from ALL OVER EUROPE assemble... People from Italy, Greece, France, Germany obviously, people from basically every major european country were part of those black block mobs. Everyone knew G20 is a huge magnet for people from that end of the spectrum, it's not like that was a surprise."
Completely agree they are hurting their own message.
"Hillary isn't in the fucking White House; I couldn't care less about that bitch. What matters is the conduct and ethics of the present administration and its associates. ""But Hillary"" is such a pathetic, cowardly non-argument that doesn't absolve your behavior at all."
Great vid
Still makes me glad I listened to my American grandfather in 1971 and stayed in Canada
"Black straight be having that White People reach sometimes. We definitely have problems, but sometimes I feel people are reaching way too far across the aisle over NOTHING."
"As far as the Apes go, as I understand it there is a scene in the movie where Caesar is whipped in a moment very reminiscent of of Glory with Denzel Washington (you know the scene I'm referring to.) 

So it's possible that the addition of this scene, and our heavy political climate made people draw connections that they are uncomfortable with."
There's always going to be violent retards in every legitimate movement.  Nothing new.
"uhm, did not Hillary get a shit ton of money for her election from Saudi Arabia?"
damn that thariq guy really is problematic
Kaaaaaaan
trump bla bla bla trump bla bla trump zzZZZZz
You think Racism is one of the biggest problems in America today.....so you go after a CGI vest.......amazing
Didn't know what an Identitarian was so I googled it. Turns out there symbol is identical to the symbol of Overwatch. Why is the symbol of Overwatch so similar to the symbol of a conservative French political group?
Responding to those tco bot comments and what not saying fake or whatever actually bumps them up the comment chain. So refrain from responding they won't respond or read your comment lol.
I love that Antifa are actually facists.
Talking about Ukraine besides a EU flag? Lmao. Now I question your agenda.
please tell me no one supports blm at this point?
B-b-but the Trump-Russia story is a nothing burger! We know this because Trump said so!
"I kind of feel like the BLM leaders are a bunch of dicks. By dicks I mean with a little friction they get all puffed up, and the more your try to calm the situation the more excited they get, and ultimately it ends in an unexpected explosion and a sticky situation that someone has to clean up."
"""-and Youtuber's Attacked"" really, English isn't even my first language and even I know better."
"To be fair though alot of the people looting/attacking aren't there for a peaceful protest or to try and support what's being said. Alot of them are just people who see protests as a way to run about and just wreck shit for no reason. It's dumb but it happens, though that doesn't dismiss everyone I just thought I'd point it out."
where is the secret link of today?
"""Protests""
Riots. They were riots. I mean come on, look at the state of the place now."

Oh crap!  PSY lost the crown!
"It doesn't hurt Antifa's cause when they riot like this, especially when all they ever do is violent riots, when they're anarcho-communists who's goal is the violent removal of thing like property rights."
would be cool if we all just can get along and not be dicks to each other for one day.
"Hillary vs Trump is not left vs right, it is centre-right vs right."
So you're gona fight antisemitism with punching people?
"These extremist leftist are hurting the progressive left voice by so much, seemed like you barely touched on the thousands of black block protestors who were extremely hostile and violent injuring over a hundred police officers. Antifa and black block are terrorist organizations and need to start being treated as such. Their methods of getting there ""voices"" heard are purely through violence and intimidation, the left needs to stop apologizing and rationalizing these types of protests and the violence and distance themselves from it."
antifa is nothing to do with anti fascism its just a thin veil they use to be nazis
"The Russian lawyer was meeting with Trump Jr. Because she wanted the Trump admin to relax sanctions against Russian criminals who are also big supporters of Vladimir Putin. So it's more like going to a meet to buy cocaine, except for instead of giving you cocaine they say they'll give you cocaine for helping them get their buddies out of jail."
You Caucasians are really finding any way to discredit the BLM movement and justify/deny racism in the Americas. Sit your asses down and maybe think about someone other than your white selves for once in your life
"I don't understand, why are there always G20 riots?"
"gangnam style has been dethroned, who shall take the mantle next."
"The leftist cause doesn't ""seem"" intolerant and violent, it is intolerant and violent. All of the mass violence instigation is coming from the left."
The police and the military should use live ammunition on antifa and black block member.They are useless to humanity.
Antifa are a domestic terror organization. Period.
"I don't pay much attention lately to things going on in the rest of the world. What is ""Identitarian"" and what do people have against it?"
"Germany obviously has to over compensate to show how much they are against Nazis since.. well.. you know... 
lol"
I'm gay
blm is a domestic terrorist group I don't listen to their b.s. anymore there almost as bad as ISIS. all lives matter is my movement like if u agree
"You mentioned that Stranger Things got a season 2 release date, but not BoJack Horseman? BoJack Horseman is a much better show. It's actually original."
"I think you are underestimating Antifa here Phil. This is not some sjw college group. This is a group of domestic terrorists who know exactly what they are doing. They started in Germany. The ones in the US, Berkeley riots, New York riots, assaults. They are ones that started up later and they are all across the country now. They are a domestic terrorist organization that seeks to radicalize people. The only reason Antifa in the US are not as violent is because they would get serous blow back from US citizens like we saw in Berkeley and government crackdown. If they could get away with the same destructive shit they would. There are different flavors of the crazy but most subscribe to straight up communism."
the violent attacks in Germany remind me of something that happened in history...ohh what was it...ohh yea Kristallnacht
great. another thing the democrats and liberals can blow way out of proportion for the next few weeks before finally admitting there's nothing there then they can move on to the next made up thing. meanwhile there are real problems going on in the world that they don't care about cause they are too busy trying to make someone they don't like look bad. what a joke.
I think I'm the most furious about Charlie Puth dethroning psy
I don't get the black lives matter movement. They have every right whites do.
These fucking spam bots
How narcissistic do you have to be to both come up with and believe that they based a chimp off you?
Well of course antifar are intolerant... weren't they also classed as a terrorist group in one of your states? Because you know...they're terrorists..
what happend in Hamburg was discussing no one likes the left

Is this how it's going to be now?"
"there wasn't any protests or protesters, just riots and rioters, Phil!"
If only we had Bernie in office none of this would be going on
I agree. You're the 1st to say investigate both sides. If the reporters would say this I would not have a problem with the media.
Fuck BLM.
"Why EVERY title in the PD all seem the same. The word ""FREAKING OUT"" is so over used in your tittles. I love your show, but please dont cave into marketing by using phony similiar tittles on all your videos."
"Phil your argument doesn't make much sense, on the right you have Trump's son who admitted to attempting to get Illegal information from a foreign government, and on the left you have the Ukraine government trying to push propaganda, those are NOT the same."
"BLM, shame
Antifa, shame
Trump Jr. shame???

I've read the e-mails and its... I don't want to say disjointed, but it's suspicious in both directions.  Cause 'technically' this could still be the fact that Russia hasn't colluded with Trump, yet there was intent.  Was this the 'only' collusion, because if this was 'literally' the only contact they've had (which I doubt but who knows) it will be a considerably minor offense in comparison to constant colluding and so forth.

And was this lawyer like, actually part of the government or was she just a loner or maybe like, was part of it and then disowned to prevent further connection???

It looks bad, but it isn't conclusive.

I mean, if this was the case, wouldn't CNN have found this stuff already?"
"People need to stop trying to defend and apologize to anti-fa, both American and European versions of this actual terrorist organization."
Whats an idertian
"Hi phil its hot
have a nice day.  :)"
"Being that the world is shrinking faster and faster and the USA has such a massive influence on the world, I don't understand why giving out information about people in the election should be banned or unlawful. I understand that they shouldn't take money and there shouldn't be some kind of propaganda one way or another. People should just be able to form their own opinions with as little influence as possible (aside from what's presented by the candidates). They claim to have incriminating information about a candidate who was already under criminal investigation, i don't see what's wrong about that."
I never thought BLM would stop doing their job on supporting and just devolved into that.. also why is Don Jr still going after Clinton.. the election is already over.. and WTF antifa bastards.. from burning trash cans to beating random people.. shame on them cause that's way too low even for them.
Where is the secret link?

"""We tried to collude! We couldn't figure it out!!"" üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
are you fucking kidding? some people are so childish and will find anything to bitch about.
The first story is why I left the BLM movement once it ceased to be about holding cops accountable and getting them to wear bodycams. Its been Occupy 2.0 in its disorganization ever since.
"Great job Phil, this felt very non partisan on you part.

We will have to see what happens in the future regarding this subject, as for now not much to do when nothing was illegal."
"Might help to stop using ""People are FREAKING OUT"" in so many video titles. I saw 4 on the visible videos on your page alone..."
"Phillip, You're missing the bigger story here... this places P. Manafort (trumps soon-to-be Campaign Manager) J. Kushner (Son-in-law), and Don Jr in the room with Russians. All three denied ever having contact with ANY RUs. Kushner has now been caught Three (3) times lying on his SF86 (security clearance application). That alone is a FELONY."
"Deray's motto: ""I love my blackness. I love your blackness""
Now imagine a white guy saying the same thing. How is Deray, an extremist leader for BLM, even allowed to use his platform to insite hate towards all non-black people. He is a shame for the BLM movement."
"The night of broken glass all over again. The lesson you should've learned from Nazi Germany wasn't Nazi's are bad, it should be unprovoked violence from all sides is bad. It's very telling of how regressives think that they're doing good things when they burn down small businesses and punch ""Nazis"". Germans will never learn, they'll only target different people..."
"My only issue with how you covered the email story is that you presented the email chain as top being first sent and bottom being newest- however, the oldest messages in the chain were at the bottom. So, you basically presented the timeline backwards as evident by the time stamps. This can make the story a bit confusing in parts."
"""Preach tolerance with their fist"" trust me, Phil, these people aren't preaching tolerance. These are the people who wish to use censorship to hide differing opinions under the guise of Hate Speech like in Germany."
Sorry Phil but Despacito is gonna take the crown away from Charlie soon.
"The Russia thing all started with an opposition research paper contracted by the Clinton campaign from a British citizen. Now we find out that the Trump campaign was looking at opposition research. If it is illegal for Trump then it was illegal for Clinton. Please, stop with all the BS and lets get back to real issues that affect us all."
So people are offended again?
"Are we really equating donating wealth and sharing information? It sounds like, yet again,  another worst case scenario where Russia committed the horrible sin of investigative journalism. I'm just disappointed they came up empty. Let's remember that the supposed thing of value was information that, if true, should be shared with the voting public. His wrong doing was looking into allegations of wrong doing. 
Break the conditioning, Phil! Don't let the reptilians have you!"
"Donald Jr. Meet with the lawyer a month before emails start to leak...I can't help wonder if the campaign learned about them during this meeting.. Also, Trump calling out for Russia to find most emails seems really bad now, because they were aware of Russia's support..doesn't look good."
MKE PSY Great again
Antifa being terroristic? Who would have guessed?
Who's hyped for the new Planet of the Ape? It looks awesome
How the fuck is a guy talking about Planet of the Apes more important than the PRESIDENT'S SON smoking gun of commited treason?
"Michelle Obama was called ""an ape in heals"", so maybe it does matter"
"what i don't seem to get is that- if this lawyer was meeting on behalf of the Russian government, even though she's said on air that she wasn't, but if she was, why would the info they were given be useless? either the Kremlin's shit at spying or something else is up. doesn't seem to make much sense that they got some useless info and some talk about sanctions placed on adopting Russian children, makes even less sense that she'd meet with people who aren't running for office, months before the election.
this whole situation seems fishy. 
since there were reports that Clinton campaign officials worked with Ukrainian government officials and nobody's been jailed for that, i doubt this is gonna land anyone behind bars, provided the report on the Clinton 'collusion' is accurate. 
just gonna wait for the investigation, honestly."
The news here should be Hillary colluded with Russia and Trump JR trying to get to the bottom of it.
"Hey.. given that Traqis got banned from YouTube, but why didn't you feature it in TiA?"
"Wait, so the fleur-de-lis is a symbol for this identitarian thing? I know I must be looking stupid right now, but I don't completely understand"
Had to pause the video just to go back and watch Gangnam style a few more times. Gotta get Psy back on top. I can't really stand Wiz Khalifa.

"Why does almost every video you release have the phrase ""FREAKING OUT"" in it? I mean, I know it;s for the Youtube algorithm or something, but it's really played out."
all i have to say is Shut Up Tariq
Shut up Traiq
"Thank you, Philip! It's refreshing to hear from someone without bias. Both sides are screwing us hard and need investigated."
"I don't even know who Deray is and I highly doubt the planet of the apes creators know who he is either lol. Planet of the apes is a movie franchise that's been going for years. It's not racism geez people don't be stupid, stupid."
WASH YO ASS
Antifa is terrorism.
"Basically the Trump Jr. story is this: You plan to rob a bank; you get to the bank; you realize it was closed, so you left. That is still conspiracy to commit a crime, and that in of itself is a crime."
"Here's my takeaway, it is the real life version of what happened in House of Cards when Spoilers






Frank went on trial and confessed saying something to the effect of ""I was playing by the rules that we, the members of congress, all agreed upon. Don't go white knighting like this because I know each and every one of you does the same. Yes I knew about the Chinese money and yes I leaked stories to the press for my own gain, so what?""

Everyone in politics does this sort of stuff, as you mentioned the Clinton campaign did much of the same. Don't hate the player, hate the game."
"I love how the only defence people can really come up with for Trump Jr. is that he's so incompetent he can't even be a criminal properly! Also the Hilary stuff needs to be investigated yes, but prioritise Trump. Not about who belongs to which party, but one is the MOTHERFUCKING PRESIDENT WITH SCOOBY DOO VILLAIN PUTIN! And the other was Hilary."
I apologize I just realized I spelled your name wrong üòÖ
I love Watsky I wish he would come back to Edmonton AB :(
Getting evidence of wrong doing by an opponent from a foreign entity isn't illegal. I don't even know if you could successfully argue that it's unethical. I don't like Trump either but this is a nothing story. When are people going to start focusing on stuff that matters? Like how to actually make healthcare work?
Trump team we tried to collude but failed. CNN the Russia story is a nothing burger.
what's bad about looking like an ape tho we're all animals too and they're pretty cute
Where's the secret link?
You can't say that don jr. didn't try but trying is just as illegal as doing like if you were to have the intention of killing someone but inevitably failed you would still be charged for it
I guess if the ape had a jerry curl and was dressed in a tracksuit. Al Sharpton would have an argument but other than that it's much ado about nothing.
"Just like his father, Trump Jr. isn't very smart, is he? ""I was thinking about do something illegal, but it ended up being boring instead, so I'm innocent, because I got fooled"" way to go, buddy."
"Lauren sturs up hate, you really think it will not come back to her, how naive."
"The only one freaking out is the loony left!    No collusion.  Never exchanged info to collude!   Funny no one was outraged about collusion and interfering when Obama was proven to have used taxpayer money to interfere in the Israeli election to try to unseat the prime minister of Israel!    Or the Clinton uranium deal, or john Podesta tied to Russian government officials and their banks and stock market!   More,selective outrage?   Trump Jr. Did not commit any crimes!"
"You don't know what he thought about the lawyer before the meeting, but you do know what the thought about the lawyer after the meeting; Baby adoptions."
It's pretty telling when it comes to the planet of the apes story. The majority of people never once made the connection between the apes and black people. Except the people who claim to be against racism. To make such a racist connection shows how they want this racist connection to continue exist.
Apes look better.
Why does YouTubers in the title have an apostrophe? Or am I just wrong
There was a video of Antifa members going into a bush and taking off their black clad ISIS like outfits. Antifa are hiding amongst peaceful protesters to insight riots. Antifa are domestic terrorists. Antifa as a group must die.
No secret link today???
9:45 leave Shrek alone
"Give up the Russia thing,so over the noise!"
Secret link?
Fuck politics.
Yea Russia is such a nothing burger insert sarcasm
"Uhhhhh, Where's the Secret Link of the day?"
"So let me get this straight, they wanted to collude, but because it didn't work out they think it's fine?"
"I feel like we have entered an age of quantum scrutiny. Instead of taking this information and dealing with it appropriately, we are expected to make it the most viewed and liked opposition on the internet. Frankly, it's terrifying just how out of proportion our thinking is."
sooo what's the defence Trump suporters are going to use now?
"bumps in to someone ""fucking NAZI"""
"I don't think Lauren Southern is an identitarian, I just think she is against the affects of mass Muslim migration. I can't say I watch her often, but I've only ever heard her talk in terms of culture and values. From what I've seen, she puts western values above Islamic values, not the white race above minority races. i think that shirt is supposed to be calling for a rebirth of western values even though it's unclear."
Well Phil sorry to break it to you but Despacito will probably be number 1 by the end of the year
"I'm a simple man. I love my daily PDS, and I love Sassy Phil."
"I find the whole Gangnam Style being surpassed thing kinda sad because it's a ""classic"". I remember being really surprised that the video had been clicked 2+ billion times. Now there are around 15 or more videos on YouTube that you can find with billions of views, so although it's still really impressive, it's not as much anymore. Still, good for all the artist who made that many views and good for Charlie Puth."
"The violent protestors scare me, but not for the reason you think. They say they're unafraid of Nazis, fascists, or identitarians, and they attack people under the guise of fighting 'the bad guys.' I know Nazis. I've met fascists, ethno-nationalists. They love it. They are looking for excuses to start fighting in the streets, and people like AntiFa are giving it to them.
If history class taught me anything, it's that we SHOULD be afraid of Nazis, and we should never use violence or shouting, because it's only a matter of time before the wrong people have the loudest voices, or the hardest fists."
"The thing is, you will not find any left wing publication or anyone of great platform condemning this.
this is called the visible argument... 
there are left wingers that say ""Well I don't support this"".
But clearly the people they support or the publications that they read will say nothing of this and if there IS something said, it is condoning this... And people wonder why the left is losing so many seats.

The rational left just doesn't have control any more."
ANTIFA ARE violent!!!!
Whats an identitariam fam
"I always assumed that the most racist people out there are the ones who see racism everywhere. ""Uh, you're white and you have dreads? Don't you know only the blacks do that? Racist!"""
to me (and maybe many others) BLM is just another terrorist group. so i don't and won't give 2 shits about whatever they say. fuck em all.
can someone explain to me Russian adoption
"So a lady, that's going to expose how the russians(government) are making illegal campaign contributions to Hillary.  Is really a government agent to help trump.  Your premise is extremely flawed."
That WFTPOTA story is the most bullshit thing ever. They filmed the movie back in 2014 / 2015 before the guy starterd wearing the fucking jacket.
Who dafuck is Durey(?) whatever?? Why does he think he's relevant? why is he on this show?
I don't think that antifa actually knows what nazism is just a bunch of angry college kids lost in their own irony
Phil. Violent Protesters aren't the actual protesters but more likely people willing to use it for their own desires
kind of want to send a long two people back to World War II let them leave for about a month and then bring them back
Wow Phil on the right side of things for once
Nazis hunted for people against there beliefs and hurt them. Antifa also hunted people against there beliefs......
Wasn't Planet of the Apes a metaphorical story about the coming race war in the first place? Pretty sure it's all been racist from the start.
"I think that Trump Jr. did the right thing with this situation. He released all of the emails. I agree with you that he pretty much said ""We tried colluding and failed""."
Wait wait wait wait wait.... His defense for there not being any collusion with Russia is that he tried to collude with Russia but it didn't work?
"""A monkey's wearing a vest in a movie about monkeys being approximately human! Must be racism and a personal attack on me.""

To me, this just says he only thinks  about himself."
Remember when Kendall Jenner ended riots with Pepsi? #goodtimes
When will antifa be classified as a terrorist group? Because it kind of needed to happen like 6 months ago... They literally had their black blocs walking down streets and setting every car on fire. They looted stores. These people are extremists and need to be stopped.
This comment section is shockingly toxic.
"subscribe me and i will subscribe you
comment if you don it"
im black but sorry they truly reaching
Well in other news the racist Tory from yesterday is being reprimanded from duty
I love see you again makes me cry every time i listen to it
Gangnam style just beat out See You Again... looks like the internet is fighting back!
MAKE GANGNAM STYLE GREAT AGAIN!!!
"Wait, I'm white. Can I not wear a blue puffy winter jacket?"
they made 2-3 planet of the apes movie's and they're just now getting triggered?
"I can understand the argument for Jr not doing anything illegal due to his non-involvement in the campaign. But the fact that Manafort and Kushner knowingly went along with it is sketchy as hell, if not illegal and outright treasonous... right? It seems like the focus of the story is too narrow, but I imagine more people will start talking about it soon as more information comes to light."
"I really respect Deray. I think he does some wonderful things and is generally a good activist. That being said, he made a completely wrong point about this movie and he should make a verbal response to this mistake. Personally, I don't think this should discredit his past or future work as an activist, and I hope that this doesn't hurt him too much in the future."
Antifa needs to be crushed.
"Hamburg is my home town. I am frustrated with what some people did to our city. Certain parts of the city were just covered in black smoke from all of the cars and dumpsters these idiots set on fire.

However, I am very proud of my home town for sticking together and helping each other out. On Sunday, tons of people came together in Altona, a part of the city badly affected by last week's vandalism, and cleared all of the garbage. Some of those awesome helpers were from completely different neighbourhoods. I love that after all of the G20 chaos, we were able to show what Hamburg is really made of - open, helpful, kind hearted people."
"[Dramatically]
Excuse me everyone, I'm offended."
"That Trump Jr. lied about his meeting should already raise red flags. If opposition research is so standard and the meeting was so kosher, then why lie about it? Why hide it? Being a liar must run in the family."
"preaching tolerance with fists, like spread freedom with guns? Kappa"
Phil you misspelled Maine in the description
"breaking news, democrats and republicans in government are lying, scheming, partisan hypocrites.. oh, that's not news? carry on then"
"I love you Philly D, but am sadly disappointed in you for leaving out an extremely important part of that law. That law is for officials only, and Don Jr is not, nor ever was an official in any capacity. Don't get me wrong, I do not like, nor voted for this administration, but this story literally amounts to nothing... and you know it."
While I don't agree with what identitarians stand for (something that I honesty never heard of until watching this video) I absolutely agree that people's response to her being there is unacceptable. Acting in an aggressive manner to her does nothing to abolish the mindset of segregation since all you end up accomplishing is proof to their notion that culture's cannot mix or live together.
"Dear Phil, 

I've been there in Hamburg protesting right in between that chaos and yes there were a violent few compared to the masses of us peaceful protesters. But the love and tolerance between us and the hosting citizens of Hamburg was incredible. The heart warming stories that happened there got buried by the ash of the burning cars. It hurts me and us peaceful protesters who took so much time and even a few mistreats by the police to see that everything we tried to protest in a peaceful way being undone by these violent actions (not only from the black block but also from the police). Now the media is only talking about the destroyed streets in the heart of Hamburg, and the misbehavior of the black block and the police. It is leading away from everything we stood for, were fighting for hand in hand. Yet again it brought this topic into your show over seas and maybe, just maybe it tickles a little curiosity out of some your viewers of why we spoke out against the G20? That would be the only good news I can hope for coming from these really bad news. 

Love and regards from one of your longest viewer,
David"
How the hell do you get called a Nazi in Germany of all places
I miss the monkey opening
"Planet of the Apes:  I think that one or two mistakes aren't going to cost the men their reputations, but it certainly will if done enough times.  I try to remember that everyone makes mistakes.  This was over reach, but it seems like they figured that out.

G20:  According to TheGabbieShow, during the G20 protests, it's very, very easy to get arrested/detained by police!  She has a story time where she talks about nearly being victim of police brutality while walking home when the G20 was talking place at her college campus.  You should check that video out!  I'll look and see if I can find it.  Personally, I would stay far, far away from the G20, especially if it's in a country where I don't speak the language.  Going to Germany and being called a Nazi is VERY scary because when I was in Germany one of my friends was nearly arrested for making a Nazi joke.  Even though we were able to communicate with them via a translator (who let them know that we were just idiots from Oklahoma), I don't think I have ever been more scared in my life.  If anyone actually thought someone was a Nazi, it could get very dangerous very fast. They do not mess around over there about that stuff.  Their laws work differently than Americas (obviously) and I hope the people who decided to protest were fully aware of how legal/illegal different types of protesting are."
"Are people this clueless that people think this kind of international collusion, deal making and information exchange isn't happening literally everywhere everyday? 
Frankly I'm surprised nothing of monetary value was exchanged here."
Its amazing this guy things hes so important that someone would put him in a multi-billion dollar movie as an insult.
"I think the problem is politicians are running the country. Trump was always a politician, he just wore business man clothing. I am tired of all their nonsense regardless of party lines."
"WHERE'S THE SECRET LINK PHIL!? IT'S TOO DAMN SECRET THIS TIME! 

XD"
"Why is it that the ""tolerant left"" is so intolerant of opposing opinions?"
"ok you become to extreme when you say that the ape in planet of the apes is about you and black people overall... I get that there is still racisme, but saying things like this makes people not take it serious, becuase all of a sudden everything is racisme..."
"dude i love my new job, i get off work right after you upload the pds."
"So when are they going to go after Hillary for getting Saudi Arabia donating to their ""charity""? People are are arguing about the Trump campaign maybe getting help from a foreign government, that woman actually did."
"I could totally see DeFranco talking about the documentary ""What the Health."" Anybody agree?"
"On the protests at the G20 summit. 

As a German I have to say that I am disgusted by the actions of the protesters. From the violence in the streets to the witch-hunt on twitter. I guess it's the perfect time to quote you on ""if you walk far enough on the left you end up on the right""..... Through this you become the person you claim to hate. Just surprised by the amount of unnecessary violence. #notthegermanyIknow"
Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation took a shit ton of money from Saudi Arabia they are guilty way more then the trumps
What was wrong with Lauren t-shirt and why was it offensive? I'm confused
"Something I've been saying for awhile; and Deray is guilty of this. This is a generation of Americans that don't have any great causes or wars, so they go around creating things to fight to feel important, which accomplishes the opposite reaction by dividing people. Are acceptance and peace really possible or do we always need a villian?"
pretty sure last time the Germans tried to use words against nazi's the holocaust happened ... Its like walking down washington D.C whipping your ass with the flag its just disrespectful.
"OMG shut the fuck up about Russia, it's so god damn annoying, give us information when this shit is over with"
Antifa are fascists...such an embarrassment
That guy pointed out a single ape among a LITERAL army of apes...let stupid people be stupid.
"Black lives do matter, yes, but so does every other life. It's so sad that BLM and its supporters don't see that."
"so he broke into a house, but because there was nothing to steal, left empty handed....I would think that is still a crime????"
"I was actually in Hamburg during the protests - and walking the streets a day after these violent acts, it was clear how destructive they were to the city - banks boarded up their windows and glass was shattered in random stores. Shops put up "" We hate G20 signs"" to avoid getting attacked. 

But I also saw the beauty of these protests, on the second day it was calm and a lot more peaceful - people were dancing and chanting and singing and pop-up happenings such as food trucks, donations from shops by the street etc. made the atmosphere way more pleasant. 

The huge police presence made me feel safe when walking the streets. 

But yes, for me at least violence is never the answer."
"When I heard about the Donald Jr. story I wanted to hear your take on it. You are the fairest news commentator out there, and my go to spot for news."
How does setting some poor random person's car on fire help your cause in any way?
"DON JR IS NOT AN ELECTED OFFICIAL..... PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN NOT BE IMPEACHED OVER THIS,,,,, EVEN IF HE WAS HE WOULD REMAIN PRESIDENT.... LOOK UP BILL CLINTON IMPEACHMENT ..... NOT TO MENTION IF TRUMP WAS REMOVED MIKE PENCE WOULD BE PRESIDENT .....YOU SNOWFUCKS/ SJW'S NEED TO UNDERSTAND HITLERY WILL NOT BE PRESIDENT...."
"ANTIFA is a terrorist organization. I can make this claim just like they can shout out that I'm a nazi with no proof.
But we got proof they are. They WANT to terrify people, no matter who they are or if they're innocent.
The marched through Arizona with mock-weapons to try and show off how they ""Were an army.""
They, as seen in this video, have attacked people because they BELIEVE that the person thinks differently.
The talk about killing our President.
ACTUAL INNOCENT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED BY BERNIE SUPPORTERS.
They bite the hand that feeds them, then scream like banshees because the hand hit them due to it.
They denounce the country that protects them over and over and over again and try to destroy it, and yet...
We do nothing.
We're all fucked."
"If you want your voice heard that is fine but the moment you start attacking people, that is when you should be put in jail"

Phil needs to talk to Tim at some point. Would LOVE to see it!
"Ah yes, Phil exposing attention cunts"
Just cause your word isnt gospel doesnt mean you arent a youtube god
"Deray, don't belittle apes because you feel like an ape is better than you (they are)."
"DeFranco I have watched your shows for years and I agree with some things you talk about, however please research more into the police videos you talk about. Perhaps hire someone that actually researches these incidents. The incident you spoke about has a lot more story. The man looked like an armed robbery suspect, which was the reason the officer stopped the man. The man continued reaching for a possible firearm. The officer was scared the man would pull his gun out and resulted in the officer firing his weapon."
real talk tho. You're straight up killin it in the button up shirt
when you said hes a supporter of blm and then said planet of the apes i yelled oh no lmao
im not
"I feel like most extremely right-wing racists/Nazis purposefully draw attention to themselves to provoke people into attacking them. While I don't condone violence many of these fundamentalists and trolls know what they're doing, they purposefully try to incite hatred so they can be verbally and even physically attacked and then try to claim the high ground afterward. Really while I don't condone violence, provoking it only to claim that you're a victim afterward is really a bitch move."
So... after you hit 5.5 mil you get the bots on you ? Cuz there r alot of nice deals ur offering now DeFranco :)
Antifa are violent and intolerant extremists. Hunting down reporters and beating them doesn't hurt their message because that IS their message. They should be regarded the same way as Isis or al-Qaida.
nothing burger
"Phil, you get on my nerves at times, but damn you're so likeable -_-"

"I'm sorry I made the mistake of having an opinion

"I'm a simple man, when I hear specific political subjects for the hundreth time, I stop listening"
"bread, mayo on bread, cheese on mayo, cut pickles on cheese= a good sandwich I just ate while watching this video"
"I think that the tweets suggesting that the new planet of the apes movie is racist are overreactions. However it is important that we acknowledge the racism in the original Planet of the Apes franchise. The original movies were a clear metaphor for the minorities rising up and taking over civilization. When civil rights activists of the time pointed this out, the the director of movie said, ""It is quite telling."" While I do think the reactions of the BLM activist and Tariq were over reactionary, it is reasonable to be suspicious of a franchise with this sort of a background."
What's Identitarian?
Got my that's amazing shirt today! so happy! Can't wait to wear it tomorrow!
Fuck Antifa
If they don't go after Clinton and her people you know this was just a political witch hunt.¬† Something tells me no one will go after Clinton.¬† Her hands were so dirty during the elections but she kept crying victim.¬† Both Clinton and Trump are disgraces and frankly it looks like they share the same morals and values.¬† No wonder the Clintons were at Trump's last wedding.
"Phil, please be more proactive in policing scammers using your name or icon in your video comment section, it's getting ridiculous."
"Here's a tip: Don't wear a far right t-shirt to an Anarchist protest, that is evidently being worn just to wind people up. Not a smart move nazi bastard"
"Well, concerning the G20-Demonstrations, I can add, that these groups, who set fire, attacked policemen and spread chaos weren't demonstrating at all. Since today, nobody pointed out any political statement, these idiots wanted to express. So all that's left are some criminals, who used the group dynamic, black masks and an overall chaotic situation, to demolish cars, buildings and property, rob supermarkets commit crimes, without getting jailed."

"Lauren Southern knew exactly what she was doing by wearing that shirt in that environment. She is just another of the alt-right assholes desperate for a fight so that they can claim that they are a victim when their instigation results in someone putting them in their place. In Lauren's case, hopefully this will send a strong message to the people working for her to work for someone else, otherwise, they will continue to be targeted, without a doubt."

"Trump Jr broke the law, plain and simple, alteast, imo. But i do want to know, could there have been some information on Hillary that the Russian lawyer didnt give? Or was it something that she just wanted to push to Trump Jr by telling him she had something he wanted? I dont know. We have to wait and see"
0:32 You got to be fucking kidding me!
...Can't see the secret link of the day.....Must be blind :(
secret link? cant find it
antifa is cancer
"I'm not sure being willing willing to listen to someone that claims to have oppo research constitutes a donation. In fact, I'm certain it does not. I can't speak to Jr's previous statements and what he recollected/implied/thought (that's for him to clarify), but I could say it's plausible that he didn't pay attention to previous inline conversations that he was fwd'd etc. on because I'm plenty guilty of that a lot of the time. It sounds FAR from a legal violation though and likely at most the moral one you mention. On the other hand, as you pointed out, there's evidence of Clinton with pay to play and none of that has been investigated/prosecuted and I don't understand how hundreds of millions of donations, quid pro quo, and RICO can just be ignored."

"Antifa are domestic terrorists. This should be made official. These cunts dress like ISIS, coordinate over social media and bring home-made weapons with the intent to cause as much devastation as possible. They even have places set up where they can remove all their black masks and hoodies, put them in a featureless bin and then escape into the night. We need to track and arrest these Antifa assholes like we do with Islamic terrorist cells."

Fuck antifa
WTF! whats wrong with these people at the G20 protest? if you light a car on fire it might blow up. and going around assaulting people won't do anything but label you as a jerk. i wish people would think twice (or more then that) before doing something.
"1. Deray is an idiot for claiming a blue vest
2. Jr. Isn't a government official. He never was and had no security clearance. That would mean that any business deals by anyone with any other country is illegal. You can't conflate what Hillary did as SoS to what Jr did with meeting someone to chat."
"I think it's wrong that they basically single outed those Youtubers who were doing nothing wrong just reporting on what's going on being peaceful but just because the content they make, the clothes they wore and just because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time (they were all hanging out together). It hurts their purpose more since they call them Nazis (a group that singled out people just to cause harm to them) making them look a little bit like hypocrites. I also think calling someone a Nazi for having a different view than you makes zero sense unless they have actually said anything that would paint them as one, it adds on to hurting your cause making it look like your group can't have a civil conversation or argument."
It would be even beter if Charlie Puth was a good singer...
Wait this isn't the 13 year old Trump Jr.
"As a supporter of BLM, don't be fucking ridiculous and believe that everyone in it is like him. Just as any activist movement today there will always be those who takes things to extreme to find offense in every little thing. I've seen the last two apes films and plan on seeing this. So far all the races of humanity have been equally in process of being wiped out by talking apes and a deadly pathogen. This man and those backing him, not all of BLM, needs to get a grip on reality."
"Saying ""But look what they did, they're corrupt and bad to..!"" is the argument of a five year old. Investigate all, like with the Trump Jr. Story."
"I wonder how Trump Jr. releasing the emails himself, knowing that it goes against his previous statements, effects the revelation that he wasn't telling the truth in previous statements, since he came clean on his own in an attempt to be transparent."
Too busy checking if im brown enough to call that monkey deray from now on
So the law just read America is definitely guilty of it. 'murica has been fucking foreign nations out of their govts democratic n otherwise as far back as recorded history.
Aren't politicians SUPPOSED to dig up dirt on your opponent?
"Hallo person here who was in Hamburg during all of this, yes there was some messed up shit going on by some, which includes the Black bloc( anarchists, destorying stuff of people who are generally their own supporters) and also by the police.  The destroying stuff and what i've seen in German and Dutch news played in 2 neighborhoods, St. Pauli and one next to it. and afcourse at the protsts places which were also near or going trough the St. Pauli district. I was told by anyone i asked or was told about the protests to not go in any way shape or form to the ''welcome to hell protest'' unless i had a death wish. I did go to the one over the weekend where about 80 000 people showed up. you know the one that was actually peacefull."
What is an identitarian?
5:31 'Kimmy Kimmel Live' interesting show. Love it so much.

BLM people caught race baiting again hmmm not surprised
It's simple: If enemy uncovers how your government fcuks you who's fault it is? Your governments or enemies who made it public?
"The G20 ""protests"" are ridiculous. If you feel strongly that facism is rising in our society and that it is a problem, you have the right to voice your argument and protest peacefully. However, when you flip cars and assault people, you are doing nothing to help your cause and are hurting innocent people. Regardless of political affiliation, if you start physically harming people or damaging their stuff, you are going too far."
"I am by no means a trump supporter, but I can see how the media are so hell bent on proving their point that he 'is incompetent' which I think is why every small shake gets scaled into an earthquake. That being said this seems to be a concerning and sure is a twist of fate when considering his email tirade. against Hillary. I by no means believe any government isn't tied up in sketchy conversations and deals, but trump went in ranting and raving about how he is so much better than that, but is proving to be much the same... Maybe if he hadn't been so controversial and now seemingly a hypocrite he would have got through this without so much of the media attack."
"I like lauren and it is because of this that Im not going to swallow the bullshit that she accidentally wore a white identitarian shirt. Look just be honest wtf. At best you did it to stir up conflict, at worst it is because you have sympathy for or believe in that movement. Which lets be clear I don't agree with that type of crap but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."
I fucking love Watsky omfgüíóüíóüíóüíó
"Doesn't this mean that Trump Jr. conspired to collude? It seems as though he was very much willing to speak with the attorney when he thought she was part of the Russian government. I'm not an expert on law or anything, but if someone is planning to go through on something illegal, but never gets the chance to do it, wouldn't that be conspiracy?"
"""We're too stupid to collude"". What an amazing argument. Also... isn't it possible that the ""Hillary info"" was a lie to get someone from The Trump campaign in the room with them?"
Secret Link?
"Since watching your show, its taught me that I should research BEFORE jumping to conclusions. Previously, I always read the headline, and casted judgement."

There is nothing as bad as representing good will american people with a few who want to make  third world war. I know american people is amazing, but damn! corporations and government is a cancer."
"Lol right wingers overextend their causes all the time, calling Dear White People ""racist"" and calling a Shakespeare play ""fascist"". And yet you never heard Phil saying it ""hurt"" their causes; he only claims a cause is ""hurt"" when it's a cause he disagrees with."
Many people are going to the PSY video to get it back to #1.

"It saddens me that BLM tries to not only justify not only their own racism against white people, but also takes the smallest things that don't apply to race whatsoever, and calls it ""racist""."

"Your comment about only draining one side of the swamp made me think about how difficult it is for anyone to be impartial. I know your goal is to present the facts and sprinkle in your opinion as commentary.

Because of how difficult it is to be impartial I propose VNN. Vulcan News Network. I don't know much about Star Trek, but it's my understanding that Vulcans do not allow emotions to interfere with their decision making. I could go on to try to sell this idea further but like I mentioned before I don't know much about Vulcans. But if they were real I think they'd make swell news anchors. In the interim I think you do a splendid job though!"
"nope that ape is 100% him and they did it just to piss this guy off and his supporters. OMG, people get offended at anything!"
"why are the Trump kids so involved in America's dealings? I don't understand why and how it is ok. If this were Chelsea Clinton with her big nose up in everything, the right would be covering it exactly the same way CNN is covering this."
"Perhaps I missed something, but wasn't the only thing Donald Trump Jr going to get was straight up information, which is why some legal experts claimed its twisting ""Something other of value"" but if that's true then I'm not sure soliciting makes sense given the same exact reason. If Trump Jr, wasn't receiving money or a painting and doesn't violate the law, then how does he violate the concept of solicitation for pretty much the same thing. If information is what's considered something other of value, then I get why it could be solicitation as well, but if one thing is excluded by twisting the law, then so should solicitation as well.  

I almost feel like it's suggesting that it's not illegal to receive information but its illegal to solicit information.  Which honestly doesn't make any sense, unless the first aspect of the law is suggesting is that you can go somewhere to receive information from an ignorant standpoint, you didn't expect to receive information but then what does the 2nd aspect of the law suggest ""No person shall knowingly solicit, accept or receive, contribution or donation"" well I mean contribution maybe applies here, but unless these two law passages have nothing to with each other, there's also the fact it says ""receive"" within this  2nd law, which completely contradicts the entirety of the first aspect of the law, since the only difference here is the ""solicitation"" part, which is awfully strange when you think about it. 

AGAIN unless I missed something here, please open my dumbass eyes and maybe there was something about money or something I just don't get it."
"If you put someone, ANYONE under a microscope and meticulously disassemble everything they've ever done, you will find something to suit your narrative. Motivated individuals have been doing this for centuries ... and most of those individuals are called politicians."

I like the way everyone is jumping on the Trump's  The Hillary campaign has taken Millions of dollars from foreign countries.  For a matter of fact Obama got caught taking Millions of dollars from a Chinese group that was guilty of crimes around the world.  And he replied.  Just because the money they gave us was from illegal gains don't mean we can not use it for good.  He gave nothing back.  And the press was silent.  Hillary at the same time took money from the same group and then gave it back.  Ted Kennedy went to Russia and tried to get them to help Carter by making Reagan look dirty.  Obama gave over 500 million U.S. tax dollars to a candidate in Israel.  We can go on and on and on.

"I follow DeRay on twitter. That tweet came up on my timeline. I though it was ridiculous, and I just kept moving. Never thought I'd see it here especially since you did not cover his thing with the NRA and the video they made about him."
"""A foreign national shall not, directly or indirectly, make a contribution or a donation of money or other thing of value...""

written between the lines with invisible ink:
""Unless it's a million dollars or more, donated to a candidates 'charity' foundation and said donation was agreed upon on a date on which both a personal relative AND a former US presidents, have been born. In which case it should be considered totally within reason!""

US politics are going from being a reallife soapopera to a reallife sitcom. :-p 

That said, two wrongs doesn't make a right... both sides sucks, the only difference is that Trump is funny to watch but Hillary is cringingly embarrassing... I prefere ""funny"" in that case, and I'm glad that, that was what the american voters decided to give to the rest of the world. :-p"
"How could CNN say the protest was ""Peaceful.""
You got the Young Turks saying these people did nothing wrong...Are you fucking serious?!"
"I fucking hate the ""notification squad"" comments"
"On the Russian story, I greatly dislike the defense of, ""well they did it too."" That's not a defense if you both broke the law. 

That said, I see the quid, but where is the pro quo? If Russia offered documents to the Trump team (Jr) and he accepted them, that would be illegal, it's certainly unethical to even have the meeting, but the documents that damned Clinton came from Wikileaks. I think of wikileaks as bi partisan, so I don't think they would accept and publish docs from the Trump team, and I don't think the Trump team was smart enough to manipulate then. 

That said, this is the closest thing to a smoking gun the left has found to the Trump Russia narrative and once again it seems to disprove the narrative, doesn't it?"
"Gahhhd I love this show , never gets old"
fuck antifa. i hope everyone connected to antifa dies in a house fire
"With the Deray situation, it was not him who initially pointed it out. It was several other big accounts on twitter who pointed out the similarities and tagged him in it. Also @ people in the comments, are y'all really gonna criticize a whole movement because someone y'all deemed as the ""leader"" of BLM overreacted?"
There's no secret link?! ~_^
Philip it's important to know that these people wern't protestors but hooligans.
"Sometimes if you listen closely you can hear the trump support, if it were any other person in the world lie wouldn't have been the worse thing Phil woulda said, disappointed Phil."
Nice ass
"Donald Trump Jr. probably lied. And if I had to guess, it was more than likely because he did this, he was the only one who knew, and publicly stating this might have hurt how his father stood with the public, as the media could've used it to validate the Russia narrative at the time.
However, it's clear that no law was broken here, as even if he knew someone else might post them, the fact that Trump Jr. DID post them himself, shows that he might not have anything to fear, and he knows it."
You do not have to tolerate hateful ideologies.  Whoever decided that tolerance meant just being a doormat can burn in a fire.

Hi Philip! Thanks for your hardwork and awesome channel. Love your videos and the information and interaction you encourage with your viewership. Best of wishes.
"So a lawyer who has no connection to Russia talked to a person who has no position in the Trump administration, and they got together and made a nothing burger."
I had some serious de ja vu when phil mentioned watsky.
"What Franco thinks is collusion isn't illegal. Comey even said so, that's why Trump was never under investigation because dirt digging on your opponent isn't illegal. 

Just like the Trump Dossier was paid for the sole purpose of opposing research and when the Brit former spy couldn't find any he made stuff up and gave it to the DNC."
Legitimate question: What the fuck is Tariiq even famous or known for besides being a racist cunt? The fuck was he doing before he became YouTube's most hated personality...
"When will Phil realize that Antifa don't want to have a conversation, it's an anarchist organization that promotes violence against anyone they redeem as opponents to their cause."
"In a political election battle the campaigns will look for anything to hurt the other candidate, they all do it but I don't see the issue. Everyone does it so what does it matter. Trump won and Hillary lost fair and square. Plus Trump himself wasn't involved. This is not news but how the game is played. While everyone keeps talking about this stupid Russia stuff real news and possible criticism of what the Trump administration and real issues that effect real people are being ignored. The media needs to drop this Russia story. It's diversions from what's really going on in the world"
Fuck Antifa
"i'm gonna be blunt in saying that calling the black bloc a protest is unacceptable. these are riots, burning of private property and assaulting people is not protest."
Do you think this countries were trying to influence in a way the election because it would benefit their countries in Some sort of way
BLM üÖ±ROKE
"So, I'm not too familiar with G20. Why were people protesting?"
"A very simple concept that seems to be lost on so many people in this country is that two wrongs don't make a right. If Trump or his administration did something illegal, Hillary also doing something illegal doesn't make whatever they did okay, and vice versa. People need to stop the Team Liberal vs. Team Conservative fight and join Team USA."
If that guy owns blue vests then I own cringy outdated avatars.
Opposition research is completely legal even if you think it's scummy.

Lol DNC and related cucks so desperate for fucking ANYTHING they can get on the Trumps lol #StillNotTiredOfWinning #CNNIsISIS
why are the videos not coming out on time?
"Remember that Trump likes to get peed on story? That came from opposition research. Trump jr. tried to do the same. GETTING DIRT ON YOUR OPPONENT isnt illegal. As to Russia connection? That Trump dossier was published by British exMI6 agent. You can't argue this foreign entity is ok, but that one isn't. Yawwwnnnn another Russian collusion story"
I love the shirt lol
I dont think you should call them youtubers.

do black people see them selves as apes? I didn't think that. I guess I'm not racist.

Secret link so secret that it cannot be found in the description....
"We're going to have to kill every single of those ANTIFA thugs and all their collaborators, whether they're non-violent or not. I don't care if they're engaged in this violent behavior or not,  all members of ANTIFA and their allies must die."

"I find it interesting how many self identified ""anti-fascists"" are using fascist tactics (harassment, bullying, and violence) against people they disagree with; not just against actual fascists, but even other legitimate anti-fascists who are opposed to using violence.

I recognize not all members of the anti-fascist movement are like this, but they really need to start self-regulating. If they don't, we're just gonna see more shootings like the one at that Republican baseball game in Virginia."
Identatarian... Someone mind explaining that one to me?
What's an Identitarian? Are they akin to white nationalists in the U.S.?
hello there Phillip DeFranco I'm a fairly new subscriber and I just wanted to say I very much so enjoy your take on things and for the most part agree with a lot of your opinions but also view thing differently as well. I'd also like to thank you as well as your channel has become another one of my antidepressants so thank you for that.
Antifa is going to keep this shit up until they push the wrong person and wind up leaving behind one of their inane little friends as a corpse.

AntiFa and these radical lefties have institutional control over the city of Hamburg and the police of said municipal.

Shame on you Phil. There's a whole lot more."
"Politics Suck.

"Phil,your comments are gospel,period"
"On the Trump Jr. story, I don't think anything is going to be done about it. Not because he is innocent but because we have already seen Trump get away with so much. It's a corrupt system."
"If Trump JR gets in trouble for this, then Hillary should get in trouble for this too. I still don't understand why she isn't in jail for the server mess and allowing people to see classify material that shouldn't have. That law doesn't care about why she did it, it only cares if she did or didn't do it.
The elite should be treated the same when it comes to the law."
"honestly, Trump Jr needs to stay tf out of politics. period. but, on a moral scale, Hillary broke more laws then him and no one batted an eye... he's just a dumbass"
somehow i think its funny that someone continued to call someone a nazischwein (nazi pig) after he made clear he didn't even speak german. that the amount of intelect you get out of antifa
"I get so tired of hearing about Anti-FA people. To me, their whole campaign is petty, stupid, idiotic, and not to mention completely against human rights.

And another thing I absolutely hate is them just going up to people who are rational, logical people, but because they don't hold the same beliefs, and call them Nazis, racists, bigots, misogynists, etc. For one, they don't really know the person they're accusing, so how would they know that the person is? They blindly trust someone else who just labels them. And then they always use violence and shouting to stifle anybody of a clear mind from being heard."

"At least the emails confirm that Trump and his cabinet are so utterly incompetent.That's hilarious.

I also have a lot of political sympathies with anarcho-communists. But too many of the most vocal ones refuse to see that black bloc tactics don't work outside of an authoritarian government."

"The ""other thing of value thing "" has potential to go all the way to the supreme court.  This is probably the most entertaining thing about Trump's presidency is watching the balance of powers actually work."
The 50 year plan.
"Draining the swamp would go along the lines of removing all who let this Russian witch hunt go on as long as it has. They're not even looking into the stuff Hillary did that you brought up. It's also speculated that she took donations from the Saudi Arabian government. If they put him under such scrutiny, they should do the same to her. Otherwise, they're just making Trump into a martyr."

"Hey Phil, not sure where to request a story, so I thought this would be the best place. Trending on youtube is a WatchCut Video about Parents talking to their kids about Masturbation. It has a huge dislike to like ratio at the moment and the comment section is flaming. The video is very in your face about the subject but I truly feel that it is good intentioned and helpful. Id LOVE to hear your take on the video and backlash, especially considering you are both a parent and a person who upholds the value of an open dialogue. Thanks Phil!"
"It would have been cool if you would have gave a little more information about what ""Identitarian"" means in the context of the G-20 protests.  I think it's referring to this but I'm not sure:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identitarian_movement"

"My biggest gripe with ""drain the swap"" is people are typically referring to the political side they don't agree with. If people are corrupt, they should not hold office. Simple. 

When a police officer pulls someone over for doing something illegal, they don't write the ticket based on political affiliation. You do the crime, you.. hopefully don't represent the United States."
"Wo wo wo wo wait wait wait, so you can't be given money from other nations in order to support your election? Wasn't Clinton fucking bankrolled by Saudi Arabia where the Saudi government paid up to 20% of her entire campaign? I mean that wasn't even tried to be hidden, it was all over, everybody knew that.

Only you are freaking out about this..
"On the G20 protests.

Even ignoring the fact that Tim and Max aren't even right wing and neither that Tim, nor Max or Luke have any professional association with Lauren aside from interviewing each other and covering the same news, attacking journalists, especially on video, makes you and your movement look incredibly bad. People see video like that and assume that you and by association the movement you represent are all a bunch of thugs and as a result take your cause less seriously. 

By all means please protest, as its a key part of a healthy democracy, but by turning violent all you show is that you are incapable of proving your point without resorting to petty scare tactics."
"So sick of this ""You hurt this by doing that"" bullshit you keep trotting out, Phil.  If people cannot see the ridiculous problem that is something like the shooting of Castile, that is THEIR FUCKING FAULT, not the fault of some random activist posting a stupid tweet.  NOTHING in Devay's tweet should be looked at by ANY REASONABLE PERSON to read, ""Obviously, I should look at the Philando Castile shooting different now because this asshole thinks Planet of the Apes is about him.""

In your words, don't be fucking stupid, stupid."
What's identitarian?
"Wait, why is no one talking about Hillary's illegal dealings with Russia? Damn, the hypocrisy of these people. If Hillary was Prez, we'd be at WW3 by now. Better a blabber mouth than an actual mass murderer. Hillary's just in it for herself and power and to enrich those who funded her campaign."

Specifically they are looking for financial dealings connected back to the Miss Universe Pageant in 2013.  This all stems from that event.  If Kusher, now a government employee went into the meetin looking for foreign opposition research and then lied about it during his security clearance forms that is criminal activity."
"I for one am burnt out on this Russia bullshit. If there was any there there, they should have saved all the hype for when something actually surfaced. 

At this point, if there's any impeachment, I and many others will take to the streets, armed, for a new civil war. 

And this is from someone who voted for Cruz in the primaries to stop Trump. 

All that matters now is stopping the post modernist, SJW and Islamist aligned regressive leftists from seizing power."

Did you just read the email conversation backwards? Because the time and dates goes from newest to oldest. :)
I'm pretty sick of any little thing involving the trump family becoming the biggest and most talked about news

Gotta love how the people who pretend to be against racism wind up being racist pricks."
"As a communist, I've been shunned by my school and bullied for my beliefs and nobody listens to what I have to say, personally I understand where Antifa is coming from. I wouldn't participate in violent protests, but like you said Phil, protesters just want their voices heard, well, after 70 years of the cold war, nobody bats an eye, nobody listens to us. Can you blame them. Phil you probably won't read this and that's fine."
"Phil, I disagree with the false equivalency your drawing between Trump and Hilary. With Trump, we have proof, emails released by Trump Jr., showing he wanted to meet with a Russian government lawyer to get dirt on Hilary, vs. a report from Politico with sketchy specifics and no names. Not the same thing. Plus, Trump won, so anything he or his people did matters way more because they were successful. Plus, Ukraine is no where near the power of Russia, and Ukraine is an ally while Russia is not."
"I still don't understand why people are so against globalisation and global cooperation, to the point they would resort to violence and rioting. Despite the fact that globalisation sometimes means working with unsavoury governments and world leaders, isn't the best way forward through an attempt at a cooperative effort to make the world a better place? Before globalisation it was a game of ""how will war shape the geopolitics of the earth next""."
Oh no! They're making jokes about Harambe :0
i just sort of space out during the american politics part of the PDS. like literally my eyes start to cross an before I know it I've missed a minute of the video
"""Two wrongs don't make a right.""  That's correct, Phil.

"The hypocrisy of ANTIFA knows no bounds, the so called prevention of fascism using methods straight out of the 1930's is not only sick it is not tolerable. The movement as a whole should be seen as what is a radical Marxist group that has no issue with using violence as a political tool. Not all protesters were with this group but those who were should treated the same way radical Islamists are. Their ideology leads to similarly not only property damage and injuries but a shut down in any discussions that could happen wit the less radical groups."
"Am I the only one who thinks BLM has taken on a life similar to the Tea Party in its early days? The BLM group has now just become angry people yelling angry things.

The only thing I take issue with in this video is you saying that Deray doesn't own the blue best. He really kind of does. In terms of being identified by an article of clothing he's up there with the man in the yellow hat.

Ive been following Charlie Puth for about 8 or so years. I remember when he did the CTFxC theme song and that was how I was introduced to him. Glad to see he has gotten recognition for his music finally.

"Can I just mention that during that image/Scene for War of the Planet Of The Apes, the only thought I had related to that Chimp in the Down vest (yes that's the real name for a ""puffy"" vest, to each their own I digress..) was: ""Wow the only cognizant ape, properly dressed for the weather.""

"Trump could walk up to a podium and shout ""I colluded with Russia!"" And no one would be able to do anything. His delusional supporters would come up with some bullshit justification, and the spineless republicans in Washington wouldn't hold him accountable because they don't care whose in office as long as they can pass their toxic and downright cruel health care and other terrible legislation. Bottom line, this isn't going to hurt Trump in any way as much as we wish it would."

"Can we PLEASE stop calling rioters protesters? There is a very clear difference between the two. Saying a 'protester' lit a car in fire means that 'protester' is a rioter and the one thing that does is lump in peaceful, legit protesters into the same group as violent criminals. Gives validation to someone who does not deserve it and strips the validation from those that do deserve it. Learn the difference and use the names/labels correctly."

I like that Planet of the Apes vest
"...because political evils always try to flip the table on truth. This thing is like Satan's version of Clinton's email scandal, where in some alternate leftist (rioter) reality everything is actuallty some rich white mans fault. Fucked. Absolutely retarded.

These comment sections have been really good lately. lol

"Antifa is just terrible 
I mean srsly they are aggressive and that makes them the real fascists"
Hey you bastard where's that secret link
"Everyone!! Please do not click or search any of the links in the comments section. There are multiple bots who will impersonate Youtubers AND other people.

Hahahahahaha he got triggered because of an ape? Lmao what a loser
I still don't understand how Trump has devoted followers. He's gone from questionable to reckless.
"black lives matter is more racist then the white people they claim to fight against...

This is crazy. ppl like this def do not help the problem with political correctness. nuts! my goodness.
Where's ma secret link?
"As more and more information comes out about the Trump/Russia or Hilary/Whoever, I'm now saying instead of saying ""this isn't right Trump shouldn't be in office,"" to ""I don't give a fuck. Trump is president, we have a right wing government and it will be that till 2020. So we can report it, protest it, but it will all be for nothing. Let's try to debate other problems in the country, and be united instead of divided."""
I don't blame those protesters for not being violent. America is angry. The country is falling apart.
We are anti-fascist and Anti-capitalism! We do that by beating anyone that disagrees with us while wearing our designer clothes and hunting people on our iphones using Twitter all brought to you by capitalism! Extremely stupid people.
"In all honesty, if you think it is a good idea to assault people to get your point of view seen, you deserve to see what happens when a bullet meets your gut or what happens when baseball bat meets your head, cause that assault will get the other person's message the same way you are."
"Throw em both in jail and let's have a new election. we didn't elect the next people in line, so we should just do it again."
"The peaceful, ""just want out voices heard"" protesters were a minority phil. 7-8 thousand violent, Jihadi-looking blacblock members setting fire, looting, and picking fights. Not enough were arrested. Fucking scum bags."
"No offence to you Phil but since you hired the new researchers, your stories, such as the Trump Jr. segment, seem to be more in depth. I see this a a great thing. You having help is bettering your channel! Love yo face!"
Most political protests attract people who are only there to wreak the place. Takes very strict stewarding to prevent trouble.
WHERE IS THE SECRET LINK???
"There have been so many complex stories about how Russia rigged the U.S. Election. But nobody can seem to prove it. It's like there's a house full of smoke, but nobody can see a fire. So now the left thinks, there's definitely a fire, let's not let the fire find us and we all die. While the right says the smoke is just fog because someone left a window open, and there's nothing to worry about."
"on ""Teaching tolerance with fists"":  i disagree on that notion that it hurts any cause, if you watched american gods i love the quote: ""anger gets shit done"" hell if you look at civil rights movements, there's a huge argument that real progress came from anger"
oooo the trump story is getting juicy and right after the PTI won here in pakistan.this has to be my birthday
You could just called the people in all black faces covered antifa because what they are
"Thank u for telling me the news, this is my favorite news sours love to you all"
"I think the main issue with the welcome to hell protest isn't the reporter that was attacked but that nothing is being done to these terrorist anarchists that call themselves Antifa. The second someone puts on a black mask and attacks innocent people because they have a different opinion or destroys other peoples property or both is inciting terror in others and should be punished as a terrorist. There is no room for regressive and damaging acts as these in a democratic society. 

P.S. I don't mean to say that what happened to the reporter is negligible, rather that it is horrible and we should destroy the cause for what happened to her at its source."
"Black bloc, blm, antifa, all need to be shut down as soon as they rear their ugly heads. I don't understand how people talking is bad but busting heads and burning cars aren't? These people are terrorists and should be treated as such."
"Just popping in to say that fair, levelhead coverage like this is why I will always watch you, Phil.  Thanks for what you and your team do!"
I don't understand how people think destroying things and hurting people will help there cause it is the most backwards logic i have ever seen
"stop, you violated the law"
"Antifa is scum, just fucking shoot them all."
"I'm getting soooooooooooooooo tired of this Russia hysteria. Is this like living in McCarthy's Red Scare age on steroids? 

The Dems have nothing to show for so they just point to this giant distraction from their corruption during the primaries and embarrassing loss of 1000+ seats in a couple years."
Blac Block and Antifa should be considered a domestic terrorist group in both Europe and the United States.
"When Blizzard was play testing World of Warcraft, they had a mechanic that would reduce your experience gain if you played too much. People hated it. So, they changed it to a bonus if you didn't play too much. People loved it, and now it's called Rested Experience. Same mechanic, no changes, but different wording. Sometimes it's all in how you frame something.

"It doesn't hurt their cause to be violent because it attracts the people they want to it, unfortunately"
"On the Trump Jr. story, the fact that it contradicts something he said PREVIOUSLY doesn't much matter. Since he said it before setting up a meeting, he may have been telling the truth and not have previously set up any meetings, and this being the first. just my thoughts."
"when you mean ""some people"" there to Riot there was 8000 anarchist communist destroying everything in sight"
I'm ashamed and disgusted by what happened at the G20. I didn't realize that mindset has reached Germany like that. Thought that was mostly in America.

"Whether anyone wants to admit it or not, racial conflict is bubbling just under the surface of society. Everyone wants it, especially hateful, racist blacks who fantasize about carrying out bloodthirsty, savage, ""revenge"" on White people.

No secret link today Phil??
"The planet of the aps poster is not racist, and anyone who thinks that it is needs to stfu. 

p.s. I'm not racist, I hate everyone the same"
"That's the issue with Antifa's, at least here in Germany. They don't care about ""overextending"". They justify their violence against police officers securing the summit (and on other occasions as well) by basically saying, ""Those guys chose this job, they knew the risk, so it's fine if we beat them up.""

That's just messed up. Makes me disgusted with the human race."
"I sort of get the feeling that these violent protesters don't actually want the change that they're screaming. They don't want peace. They don't want tolerance. They don't want solutions. What they seem to want is an excuse to hate, to be angry, and to harm others and to feel like they are ""good people"" for being so malicious. I say this because that's what their actions indicate and actions speak louder than words. It's a shame and I have no idea what the solution for it is."
"Tariq not false flagging? Well he kinda have to now, seeing he's been terminated."

"Philip, i was wondering if you see Tim Pool, luke rudkowski, and Lauren Southern as independent journalist or just youtubers?
In your video you call them youtubers and youtube reporters. Not once do you call then independent journalist, why is that?"
No major societal change has ever happened without violence.  Never.  Never has happened.  Never will happen.

He said none of the meetings come to mind. Not that he never had any meetings. This is a none story to me. The rampant Russiaphobia that the MSM is perpetuating is ridiculous. Fake news in my opinion
nice one chief. love getting my news here!
Hey Philip you need to cover the parents teaching kids how to masturbate............its disgusting
Kimmy Kimmel Live

Didn't Charlie also write an intro for you once Phil?
"I can understand that german guy. He is into it, finds out someone who is seems to be a nazi is standing close to him and looses his cool. I think I get why that happend. It is wrong, obviously. I don't know what I would've done. Not the same thing but i don't know what, I would have felt very very uneasy though."
"You don't hit Nazis. Don't hit anybody for their ideas. One, because ideas themselves aren't actions or threats to action, and two, because anything contrary to the popular opinion is considered Nazi. Phil has been called a Nazi! To say punching, stalking, threatening Nazis is okay without being provoked is problematic because you're validating violence against yourself whenever the time comes to have a different opinion."

"Liberals and conservatives must take a stand against Antifa.  Antifa is a terrorist anarchist organization, not a liberal tolerance group."
"A great philosopher once said ""Better mad with the crowd than sane alone"""
"Antifa are ironically, modern day Nazi brown coats. They use violence to push their socialist ideas, because the facts aren't on their side. Yes, you read right. Socialist. Hitler was a socialist who thought capitalism was the enemy of the people. Just like Antifa. The pieces just REALLY fall into place, don't they?"
"Philip, I love you, but you gotta understand that more people dont ""do"" logic than those who do. It makes plenty of sense to you and me and lots and lots of other people that what they're doing is stupid, and doesn't help at all, BUT they don't get that. 

For them, its usually not about the thing they're ""fighting"" for or whatever, its not about some overall goal, it's about self satisfaction.  They do petty things like call people Nazi and make false claims cos it makes them feel like they're doing something, even if in the run they're really not, cuz."

They came from all over the world, Russia, Greece and so on. Some say that there were even people from the far right so that they can destroy things and blame the left extremists for it."
Day 2 of well meaning people doing stupid things

Can I just say that Hillary Clinton NEVER asked Chelsea Clinton to sit in on ANY meetings
"Only thingI have to say about Planet of the Apes is calling BULLSHIT on a horse being able to carry a full grown Gorilla, as they can weigh upwards of 500lbs and the average horse can only carry roughly 250lbs."

"One dumb comment does not destroy a person's credibility. Everyone has said something dumb in their lives. If he realizes his error and deletes his comment, that shouldn't effect how people view his other valid comments. Debunk the theory and not the person."
Eyy its ma boi tim.
stop saying first idiots ahh just stop
where's the secret link Phil?
"Not only are these violent protesters hurting their own cause to the eyes of outsiders, the pacific protesters or supporters of the the cause may start to be ashamed of supporting the movement, just like crazy extremist feminists make normal, reasonable feminists embarrassed of supporting feminism."
"Is it ok to want people, who attack others for their believes, hurt 10 fold?

I mean...... come on.....

Seriously....?"
"Deray doesn't realize that many minority groups throughout the world have been depicted as ""apes"" or ""monkeys"" by the people who believe they are superior to them, here is an example of the Irish being depicted as... well apes. Even the term ""Mountain Monkey"" has been used against the Norwegians, granted nowadays it has the same sting that ""cracker"" does.

dude the shooting of philando was 100% justified.
"Just sitting here watching Phil and realized that the view counter was at 19 and thought to myself that I'm surprisingly early for one of his videos. I then noticed that the likes were at 267 and thought, ""yeah, that seems about right for the internet..."" XD"
I totally disagree. Blue vests are racist and we need to make people aware of these racist clothes.

"I'm not saying the people beating up the guys at G20 were right, but in Germany they're super touchy and sensitive about the Right-wing, and rightly so considering their past. They absolutely shouldn't have attacked or stalked anyone but I do see why they'd get that emotional over it."

"I remember when Charlie Puth sang the 'stay tuned to Philly D's news, see what phil has to say"" intro. Good for him man."
DO YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE?? TELL ME FUCKING NOW!! LET'S HAVE A FUCKING CONVERSATION MOTHERFUCKER!!
"""My opinion is not gospel""
HOW DARE YOU BLASPHEME YOURSELF, YES IT FUCKING IS"
"""my voice is not gospel""
oh heck yeah it is to me üôåüèº"
"The planet of the apes controversy is nothing, it just seems like they are over reaching in trying to be offended. There are far more important things in the world to protest."
Chinese people were also depicted as apes. So were irish.
The connotation of Protest has been completely destroyed for me. It seems it's just not the same as it was back in history books when they were peaceful and productive...
"The true crime is not wearing a blue vest, but wearing a vest at all."
fake news
"""she""? I'll have you know Lauren Southern is actually a male attack helicopter. Check your privellege Philip!"
WOOOOOO!!! TUESDAY!!!!
"ANTIFA looks trashier everyday... I don't think it's about tolerance at all I think it's mild vigilantism, they believe ""punching a nazi"" is them meting out justice. They're the perfect example of why mob rule not only doesn't work, but it is often wrong in who it targets because of emotional immaturity and a gap in logic."
Fuck antifa and fuck Blm
how could you not talk about what the protest were about? :(
early squad
Just because Puth is a YTer aint gonna help his music from being shit #cheapshot
youtubers not youtuber's just to let ya know. i think
"So a guy sees a CG ape in human clothes (or specifically a blue vest) and assumes either ""that's me"" or ""that's supposed to be a black guy""...and then accuses the studio of being racist. How exactly is he not the racist for thinking this in the first place? There was no indication or anything from the studio was that supposed to even come close to connecting the two (ape and black people), his mind just jumped straight to it."
watsky Hype :3
"Unrelated to the video, but I got my That's Amazing shirt today!! I love it! The best part is that the sales were donated, but when I look down it makes me smile."
Oh... So people are freaking out about Emails now? Where the fuck were you on the Hillary Emails or the Podesta Emails? This bullshit Trump Jr. Muh Russia Emails is a fucking joke. Why is Defranco following the MSM into its gaping tomb? Every time I think he takes a step forward with calling out bullshit he takes 2 steps back and pulls the same shit that CNN and NYT does. Fuck.
"I find it offensive that Deray compared himself with an ape, the ape did nothing wrong to deserve that."
People are freaking out today! At least Phil doesn't have a broken neck.
Fuck Antifa!!
"I'm not justifying the attacks on Southern or the idenitarians, but if you are wearing a racist/nationalist sign, don't act surprised when you are attacked...provocative ideologies will provoke"
My only thought is I'm looking forward to another 3 1/2-7 1/2 years of President Trump. ‚ù§
"I just want my rights to be respected, bitch. pulls out knife Please don't bully me. pulls out grenade launcher"
BLM and Antifa are garbage.   Terrorist organizations.
What is a identitarian?

This comment section is so cancerous
"I am a simple fan, I see a Philip video, I press like button."

the only thing I got to a about the G20 SJW fucktards that fucked up the people around Lauren Southern. Congratulations you've just destroyed your arguments by attacking innocent people.
Anarchy... sigh
"Over extending is the theme. 
I would add that a large percentage of the protesters don't understand what it is they're protesting."
"Black lives matter has become a joke.

Most people on it are looking for victim status.

How about we quit rioting and playing victim and you sit down and actually talk to someone and BRING ALL PEOPLE TOGETHER.

"Dude. Poor fucking Tim Pool. Guy seems like the most reasonable and levelheaded man out there, and people were sending him death threats all because he wouldn't take a side."
"You're right, your opinion is not gospel... Trey's on the other hand... Received my ""That's Amazing"" shirt yesterday!!!"

"I saw the trailer and planet of the apes is completley referencing BLM. The apes shout ""No justice no peace"". But I dont think they are calling black people apes. I just think they are trying to relate the themes of the movie to current issues."

"Too many people think inside their bubble, my parents called it thinking the world revolves around you, which is what Deray did here with this planet of the apes nonsense"
Antifa are terrorists
Kimmy Kimmel? lol üòÇ
some people trying to prove their point go to far and hurt their cause
"When you punch a nazi you lose a chance to gain the ground in regards to everyone on the ideological fence. Don't be stupid, stupid. Humans don't learn tolerance w/ falcon punches."
I got a blue vest like that should I be offended?
Oops. Phil said Nazi --> Video Demonitized
"I'm disappointed that so many black people jumped out the window and thought the ape was Deray. I'm glad I was skeptical of the tweet and didn't jump on the bandwagon. It's annoying because now this will be used as an example of ""black people complaining and bringing race into everything"" to disregard actual issues. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

4:59 When you do something great but nobody knows its you
Some people just get offended because they can...
"stranger things comes out on my birthday, best birthday present!!!"
These protests are a perfect setting to try out some sarin gas or a nerve agent.
I'd be really confused if someone accused me of being an Identitarian... mainly because I have no idea what one is...
Another FREAKING OUT title.
"LAUREN SOUTHERN IS A MAN HOW DARE YOU ASSUME HER GENDER!!!

No really. She wondered how hard it would be in Canada to officially change your gender on her ID. Didn't take long...."
All of Anitfa deserve to be labeled the terrorists that they are and be killed if they show up.
"Dan, Phil and arlo at the same time, 
Aaahhhh"
i love you all
people like deray and tariq only hurt their own causes. minorities have real struggles and they make them seem like jokes
AntiFa is a terrorist organization
The downside of  being early is that there are no serious arguments or comments yet.
[this video has been flagged by Tariq Nasheed]
Is it bad that I plan my day around the watching the pds at 10pm uk! Ps love you phil x

doesn't the us Constitution defend the right to criticize the government with violence?
"If you think a movie that has apes as there main cast is somehow insulting black people, I think you should really reconsider your own perception of black people."
"i do think he was stupid in thinking the way he did about the vest, but also that people would be smart enough to tell the difference in the situations of someone calling out a movie for using a vest and a human life being taken, though i could be wrong."
"Speaking of Tariq Nasheed, his YouTube channel got terminated"
Phil there's always been riots during g20 meetings. Why do you act like this is new or something?
Antifa is at best a Hate Group: at worst a Terrorist one.
"""My opinion is not gospel"" Praise be, praise be."
Germany is a shithole full of cucks and people sad about their past.
"Antifa nazis attacking Lauren! lefties love to be nazis, this is kristall nacht 2.0."

Yo who's hyped for the new planet of the apes!
"This made my day,  my kitten rocky died today and philly d (like always)  cheered me up thx philly love yah"
The planet of the apes thing was NOT an action figure. It's a pop bobble head. And they are absolute trash.

"I can't find anything useful or related to comment, so im just gonna post a soft chocolate chip cookies recipe:

The best soft chocolate chip cookies
serves: 12 cookies (or 9 if you make the cookies huuuge, which i often do)
 
INGREDIENTS
8 tablespoons of salted butter
¬Ω cup white sugar (I like to use raw cane sugar with a coarser texture)
¬º cup packed light brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 egg
1¬Ω cups all purpose flour
¬Ω teaspoon baking soda
¬º teaspoon salt (but I always add a little extra)
¬æ cup chocolate chips (I use a combination of chocolate chips and chocolate chunks)
INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds to just barely melt it. It shouldn't be hot - but it should be almost entirely in liquid form.
Using a stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the butter with the sugars until creamy. Add the vanilla and the egg; beat on low speed until just incorporated - 10-15 seconds or so (if you beat the egg for too long, the cookies will be stiff).
Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until crumbles form. Use your hands to press the crumbles together into a dough. It should form one large ball that is easy to handle (right at the stage between ""wet"" dough and ""dry"" dough). Add the chocolate chips and incorporate with your hands.
Roll the dough into 12 large balls (or 9 for HUGELY awesome cookies) and place on a cookie sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes until the cookies look puffy and dry and just barely golden.Warning, friends: DO NOT OVERBAKE. This advice is probably written on every cookie recipe everywhere, but this is essential for keeping the cookies soft. Take them out even if they look like they're not done yet (see picture in the post). They'll be pale and puffy.
Let them cool on the pan for a good 30 minutes or so (I mean, okay, eat four or five but then let the rest of them cool). They will sink down and turn into these dense, buttery, soft cookies that are the best in all the land. These should stay soft for many days if kept in an airtight container. I also like to freeze them.
NOTES
The 3 most important things about this recipe are 1) melting the butter, 2) adding enough flour, and 3) not baking for too long.

If you find that the dough is wet and it REALLY sticks to your hands, you probably need a little more flour. This is important otherwise you'll have flat cookies. I'll usually add a few tablespoons at a time to get it to the right consistency. You should be able to roll the balls of dough between your hands without any issues. ENJOY!üòÅ"
Lol that shade tho
